Nikita Nekrasov (Russian: Ники́та Алекса́ндрович Некра́сов; born 10 April 1973)[1] is a mathematical physicist and string theorist at Stony Brook University in New York.[2]
Background[edit]
Nerkrasov studied at the Moscow State 57th School in 1986–1989.[1][3] He graduated with honors from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology in 1995, and joined the theory division of the Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics. In parallel, in 1994–1996 Nekrasov did his graduate work at Princeton University, under the supervision of David Gross.[4] His PhD thesis on Four Dimensional Holomorphic Theories was defended in 1996. He was then selected to become a Junior fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows at Harvard University from 1996–1999, then a Robert. H. Dicke Fellow, Princeton University from 1999 to 2000. In 2000 he became a permanent professor at the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques.[3] During 2010 he was a visitor at the C. N. Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics and Simons Center for Geometry and Physics at Stony Brook University.[5] In 2013, he moved to the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics at Stony Brook University as a full professor.
Research[edit]
Nikita Nekrasov is mostly known for his work on supersymmetric gauge theory and string theory. Nekrasov partition function, which he introduced in his 2002 paper Nekrasov, Nikita A. (2002). "Seiberg-Witten prepotential from instanton calculus". Adv. Theor. Math. Phys. 7: 831–864. arXiv:hep-th/0206161. Bibcode:2002hep.th....6161N. , relates in an intricate way the instantons in gauge theory, integrable systems, and representation theory of infinite-dimensional algebras. For his discovery of noncommutative instantons together with A.Schwarz in 1998, noncommutative monopoles and monopole strings with D.Gross in 2000 and for his work with A.Gorsky on the relations between gauge theories and many-body systems he was awarded the Jacques Herbrand Prize of French Academy of Sciences, in 2004. For his contributions to topological string theory and ADHM construction he received the Hermann Weyl Prize in 2004. In 2008 together with D.Maulik, A.Okounkov and R.Pandharipande he formulated a set of conjectures relating Gromov–Witten theory and Donaldson–Thomas theory, for which the four authors were awarded the Compositio Prize in 2009.
