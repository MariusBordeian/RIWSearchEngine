Eric Zaslow

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Eric Zaslow is an American mathematical physicist at Northwestern University. He attended Harvard for his Ph.D in Physics. [1] His research focuses on mathematical questions arising from duality symmetries in theoretical physics such as mirror symmetry. With Andrew Strominger and Shing-Tung Yau, he formulated the SYZ conjecture.[2]
He is also known for being internationally ranked in ultimate, with seven world or national championships[3] and has written limericks about physics competitively.[4]
