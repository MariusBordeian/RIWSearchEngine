Mathematical theory - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia




Mathematical theory

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

For other uses, see Mathematical theory (disambiguation).
The term mathematical theory is used to refer to a mathematical subfield. A theory can be a body of knowledge, and so in this sense a "mathematical theory" refers to an area of mathematical research.[1][2] This is distinct from the idea of mathematical models. Branches of mathematics like group theory and number theory are examples of this.
