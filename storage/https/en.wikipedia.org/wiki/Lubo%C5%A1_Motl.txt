Luboš Motl (born December 5, 1973) is a Czech theoretical physicist. He was an assistant professor at Harvard University from 2004 to 2007. His scientific publications are focused on string theory.
Life and career[edit]
Motl was born in Plzeň, present-day Czech Republic. He received his master's degree from the Charles University in Prague, and his Doctor of Philosophy degree from Rutgers University and has been a Harvard Junior Fellow (2001–2004) and assistant professor (2004–2007) at Harvard University. In 2007, he left Harvard and returned to the Czech Republic.
Despite being an undergraduate at a Czech university where none of the faculty specialized in string theory, Motl came to the attention of a noted string theorist, Professor Thomas Banks, in 1996 when he "scooped" Banks with an arXiv posting on matrix string theory.[1] "I was at first a little annoyed by [Motl's] paper, because it scooped me," said Banks. "This feeling turned to awe when I realized that Lubos was still an undergraduate." While at Harvard, Motl worked on the pp-wave limit of AdS/CFT correspondence, twistor theory and its application to gauge theory with supersymmetry, black hole thermodynamics and the conjectured relevance of quasinormal modes for loop quantum gravity, deconstruction, and other topics. He is the author of L'équation Bogdanov, a 2008 French-language book discussing the scientific ideas and controversy of the Bogdanov brothers.[2]
He writes a science and politics blog called "The Reference Frame: Supersymmetric world from a conservative viewpoint", which has been described as an "over-the-top" defense of string theory.[3] Following the example of Oriana Fallaci, he characterizes himself as a Christian atheist.[4][5]
In January 2016, The Reference Frame was the first source to state that the LIGO experiment detected a merger of two black holes.[6][7][8] The discovery, known as the first observation of gravitational waves, was officially announced one month later.
