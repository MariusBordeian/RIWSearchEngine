Gregory Moore, 2012


Gregory Winthrop Moore (born 1961) is an American theoretical physicist who specializes in mathematical physics and string theory. Moore is a professor in the Physics and Astronomy Department of Rutgers University and a member of the University's High Energy Theory group.[1]
Moore's research has focused on: D-branes on Calabi–Yau manifolds and BPS state counting; relations to Borcherds products, automorphic forms, black-hole entropy, and wall-crossing; applications of the theory of automorphic forms to conformal field theory, string compactification, black hole entropy counting, and the AdS/CFT correspondence; potential relation between string theory and number theory; effective low energy supergravity theories in string compactification and the computation of nonperturbative stringy effects in effective supergravities; topological field theories, and applications to invariants of manifolds; string cosmology and string field theory.
Moore won a 2007 Essays on Gravitation Award from the Gravity Research Foundation for his essay, joint with Frederik Denef, How Many Black Holes Fit on the Head of a Pin? [2][3] In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[4]
Moore won the 2014 Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics "For eminent contributions to mathematical physics with a wide influence in many fields, ranging from string theory to supersymmetric gauge theory, conformal field theory, condensed matter physics and four-manifold theory."[5] In 2015, he was jointly awarded the 2015 Dirac Medal by ICTP.[6]
Moore was a member of the Advisory Board for Springer's Encyclopedia of Mathematical Physics.[7]
