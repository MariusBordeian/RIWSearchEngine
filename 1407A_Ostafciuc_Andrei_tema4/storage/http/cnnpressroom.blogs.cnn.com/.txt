Trump defends criticism of judge with Mexican heritage
 
Text Highlights
 
Trump on Clinton’s “thin skin” comment: “Well, first of all, I don't have thin skin, I have very, very strong, very thick skin.  And when somebody is right about me, I always - you know, if you do a report and it's not necessarily positive but you're right, I never complain. I do complain when it's a lie or when it's wrong.  But I have a strong temperament and it's a very good temperament and it's a very in control temperament or I wouldn't have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn't have built all of the things that I've been able to do in life. I mean, number one best-sellers, one of the best-selling books of all time, tremendous television success...[TAPPER]  I don't think anyone is... [TRUMP] I've been successful. Well, wait a minute, Jake. I've been successful in every business I've been in, if you think, real estate one of the most successful.  Uh, television, "The Apprentice," which is, forget it.  I mean NBC came to me.  They wanted to renew so badly you have no idea. [TAPPER]  But what does that have to do with temperament?...... [TRUMP] Oh, you can't have that success without good temperament. And I will say this.  I was thinking about the word temperament.  And we need a strong temperament in this country.  We have been led by weak people, weak ineffective people.  Countries have taken advantage of us, whether it's militarily or otherwise.  We have been taken advantage of by everybody.  We have people with weak temperaments. I have a very strong temperament.  But I have a temperament that's totally under control.  And, you know, you - she - she mentions that I'll bring us into war.  She's the one that wanted to go into Iraq.  I mean she raised her hand.  She didn't know what the hell she was doing.  She raised her hand. I said, I don't want to go into Iraq, Iraq is going to destabilize the Middle East and I was 100 percent right.”
 
 
Trump responds to criticism of judge with Mexican heritage “….[TRUMP] Do you know that these people went to every attorney general, practically, in the country that they could and do you know this case was turned down by almost every attorney general, from Texas to Florida to many of these states? [TAPPER]  Is it not, when Hillary Clinton says this is a racist attack and you reject that, if you are saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism? [TRUMP]  No, I don't think so at all. [TAPPER]  No? [TRUMP]  No.  He's proud of his heritage.  I - I respect him for that. [TAPPER]  But you're saying he can't do his job because of that. [TRUMP]  Look, he's proud of his heritage, OK.  I'm building a wall.  Now, I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. [TAPPER]  He's a legal citizen... [TRUMP]  You know why I'm going to do well with Hispanics? Because I'm going to bring back jobs and they're going to get jobs right now.  They're going to get jobs.  I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. But we're building a wall.  He's a Mexican.  We're building a wall between here and Mexico.  The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings, rulings that people can't even believe.  This case should have ended years ago on summary judgment.  The best lawyers - I have spoken to so many lawyers, they said this is not a case, this is a case that should have ended. [TAPPER]  I have... [TRUMP]  This judge is giving us unfair rulings. Now I say why? Well, I want to - I'm building a wall, OK, and it's a wall between Mexico, not another country...”

CNN to deliver comprehensive EU referendum coverage 
Multiplatform news, debate and analysis of UK’s crucial vote
London, 2 June 2016: As the UK prepares to vote on whether to remain in the European Union, CNN will offer a mix of special ‘Brexit’ programming to audiences around the world, across TV and digital platforms.
Leading up to the poll on 23 June, CNN’s most experienced journalists will be getting to grips with the issues facing UK voters, and the implications of their decision for Europe and the world.  The network will take to the UK’s roads, host an interactive debate show, and provide the latest news and reaction as the results come in.
Gill Penlington, Director of News & Event Programming, EMEA at CNN International, said: “There is so much information, misinformation, conjecture and opinion around this vitally important story.  We’ll be talking to leading lights from all angles of the debate, debunking some of the myths, and getting into the minds of the voters whose decision will have implications across the world.”
Following the story will be CNN journalists including anchors Hala Gorani, Max Foster, and Nina dos Santos, as well as Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson.  They will be joined by CNNMoney Editor at Large, Richard Quest, and Chief International Correspondent, Christiane Amanpour.
Key programming and content:
On digital:
Full coverage of the referendum can be found at CNN.com/Brexit – including explainers, opinion, and the very latest news.
On CNN International:
From Monday 13 June, Richard Quest will be taking to the UK’s roads in a 1970s campervan for a week, to get the mood on the ground.  Visiting iconic locations he will talk to voters, as well as leading voices from business, politics, academia and culture.  In addition to updates through the day on CNN International and extensive coverage on CNNMoney, Quest Means Business will also be anchored live from the campervan throughout the week at 9pm GMT/10pm CET.
On Thursday 16 June at 7pm BST/8pm CET, Christiane Amanpour will host an interactive ‘Brexit reality check’.  Recorded at the McLaren Thought Leadership Centre, UK Decides: In or Out will feature a panel of high profile guests from both sides of the debate. Max Foster will be marshalling the studio audience, who will use high tech, interactive voting technology to have their say in real time on the key issues.
On Thursday 23 June, the day of the referendum itself, CNN will present coverage throughout the day.  Then, from the moment the polls close, at 10pm GMT/11pm CET, there will be rolling coverage of the results.  Anchored live from London, with correspondents stationed in key locations in the UK and Europe, CNN will bring up-to-the-minute developments through the night as the votes are counted.  The result will then be dissected the next day, with the ramifications for the UK, Europe and the world put under the microscope.
ENDS

Update! Season Four Premiere of CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man Launches Friday, June 3, 10pm, ET/PT 
New Season Includes Spurlock’s Inside Look at Space, Gambling, Toxins, Disruptors, CSI and Gamers
Popular CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man, hosted and produced by the Oscar®-nominated documentary filmmaker, launches its fourth season on Friday, June 3 at 10pm ET/PT with an inside look at professional gambling.
In his inimitable, inquisitive style, and with a sense of humor intact, Spurlock tells compelling stories from an insider’s perspective. In the new season Morgan tackles toxins, gambling, the space industry, disruptors, gaming, and crime scene investigations.
The multiple award-winning program averaged 546,000 total viewers and 244,000 Adults 25-54 for premiere episodes in season three (1/22-3/19/15) and posted its highest season performance ever among both Adults 25-54 and total viewers. It surpassed its season two average (airing on Sundays at 10pm) by 7% in Adults 25-54 (228,000) and 27% in total viewers (429,000).*
For embeddable clips from the new season, please click on the following link:  http://www.cnn.com/shows/inside-man
Below are descriptions of Morgan Spurlock Inside Man season four episodes (airdates subject to change):
DOUBLE OR NOTHING (airdate June 3 2016)
Spurlock enters the seductive world of professional gambling by spending a week in Las Vegas determined to beat the house. His exploration of this pastime, which often leads to serious addiction, takes him to casinos, bookies, the racetrack, Off Track Betting and just about any place that allows him to gamble.
ONE GIANT STEP FOR MORGAN (airdate June 10, 2016)
Spurlock “virtually” experiences life as an astronaut and investigates the future of the space industry. The host’s journey takes him to government and private facilities including NASA’s Johnson Space Center (Houston), the X-Prize Foundation (Culver City, CA.) and Virgin Atlantic’s Mojave Air & Space Port (CA.) to see how the rules of the game are changing and what it means for the human race.
THE TRUTH ABOUT TOXINS  (airdate June 17, 2016)
In a quest to rid his life of contaminants – which are prominent in food, cleaning products and even furniture, Spurlock gets professional help to “de-tox.” The host puts his body to the test, dabbling in chelation therapy, infrared saunas, electromagnetic-free sleep chambers, and various cleanses, to see if poisons can truly be flushed out of our bodies and surroundings in the modern world.
CSI: SPURLOCK (airdate June 24, 2016)
Separating fact from TV dramatizations, Spurlock embeds in a forensic science unit to understand first-hand how crime scene investigations are actually conducted.  From the first responders, to the collection of evidence (at CSI Academy in Alachua, FL and ATF training facility in Huntsville, AL) and its analysis in the lab, he gets a crash course in Crime 101 from beginning to end.
GAME CHANGERS (airdate July 1, 2016)
Screaming fans, sold-out arenas, and teenage superstars, Spurlock joins the ranks of professional video gamers in one of the fastest-growing sectors of the “sports” world. Committed to understanding this shockingly intense industry, he joins reigning League of Legends North American Champions, from Counter Logic Gaming, as they train to compete for a big cash prize at the World Championship in Paris.
SEEK AND DISRUPT! (airdate July 8, 2016)
Inspired by companies like Google, AirBnB, and Spotify, Spurlock attempts to fill a void in the marketplace and re-write the rules by becoming the next disruptor. An eye-opening trip to Silicon Valley provides industry advice from tech giants, and examines why companies like Uber often leave a trail of enemies in their wake and questions whether this golden era of tech will solve age-old problems.

Meet CNN Digital's New VP of Programming: Mitra Kalita 
Meet Mitra Kalita. She’ll be making a big move from the left coast to the right to head up programming for CNN Digital in the coming weeks. Mitra joins CNN from the Los Angeles Times, where she is serving as the publication’s managing editor. Before that, she was the executive editor of Quartz. She’s also worked for the Wall Street Journal, Mint and the Washington Post.
In her new role as VP of Programming, Mitra will lead CNN Digital’s efforts to creatively share its journalism and storytelling across an ever-exploding array of platforms. She will oversee the News & Alerting, Special Projects, and Mobile & Off-Platform teams. Mitra will be based in the Big Apple and report to Editor-in-Chief Meredith Artley.
Since no one really likes press releases, we decided to mix things up with a Q&A. Read on and join us in welcoming Mitra to CNN: @MitraKalita.
What’s your guilty pleasure?
Chips. Uber. Bright tights. The Office. The TV show, not the place.
VP of Programming sounds like a TV title.  What does that mean for Digital?   
The success of our journalism rests on two important factors: how good is the story and how good is the distribution. How adaptive are we to different devices and different platforms? How accessible, relatable, intimate, authoritative? Technically, I will oversee the homepage, alerts, projects and planning, mobile news and off-platform partnerships and initiatives. But really, I see this job as one that collaborates across departments, time zones and mediums to maximize the reach of our journalism.
If you weren’t a journalist, what would you be doing?
I can’t think of anything else I’d rather do.

TWO-TIME SUPER BOWL CHAMP AND 'DANCING WITH THE STARS' MIRRORBALL WINNER HINES WARD JOINS HLN’S 'MORNING EXPRESS WITH ROBIN MEADE' AS SPORTS CONTRIBUTOR
Ward to Also Provide Sports Commentary and Analysis Across all CNN Platforms
Hines Ward, two-time Super Bowl champion and Dancing with the Stars Mirrorball trophy winner, joins HLN’s Morning Express with Robin Meade as sports contributor.  Based at the network’s headquarters in Atlanta, Ward will also provide analysis and commentary on major sporting events and breaking news across all CNN platforms, including CNN/U.S., CNN Digital, CNNMoney and CNN International.
Beginning July 1, the Super Bowl XL MVP, joins the popular HLN morning crew of host Robin Meade, meteorologist Bob Van Dillen and consumer business correspondent Jennifer Westhoven. Morning Express with Robin Meade is a ratings juggernaut for the network.  The wildly successful morning show is up double-digits year-to-date in both total viewers and persons 25-54.
“I’m incredibly grateful to HLN and CNN for welcoming me to their prestigious team,” said Ward. “Throughout my career, I’ve always envisioned myself as more than just a football player and this platform will allow me to express myself in different and unique ways. I’m excited to be able to share my journey and my stories with our audiences, both in the US and worldwide.”
“Hines is a true champion with such a winning personality,” said Bill Galvin, SVP, Sports Programming, CNN.  “His perspective on sports extends well beyond the football field – a fresh voice we’re excited to share with HLN and CNN audiences.”
Upon his retirement in 2012 from the NFL, where here he played for 14 years with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ward trained and completed the 2013 Ironman World Championships held annually in Hawaii. He began his television career as an analyst for NBC’s Sunday primetime NFL show, Football Night in America.
He founded and operates Helping Hands Foundations both in the U.S. and Korea, and is an active participant with numerous other charities including The Caring Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and Pearl S. Buck International. Ward also started an after-school education program for kids in his home state of Georgia, where he attended Forest Park High School and went on to be a top scholar-athlete at the University of Georgia, earning All-SEC honors his senior year and finishing his college career as Georgia's second all-time receiver with 144 receptions. He currently lives in Atlanta with his wife and son.
Ward is represented by CSE Talent, which offers management and career assistance to its elite roster of over 200 clients including pro and collegiate coaches, baseball players, golfers, management, and news and sport media talent.

CNN Story: 
Trump defends criticism of judge with Mexican heritage
 
Text Highlights
 
Trump on Clinton’s “thin skin” comment: “Well, first of all, I don't have thin skin, I have very, very strong, very thick skin.  And when somebody is right about me, I always - you know, if you do a report and it's not necessarily positive but you're right, I never complain. I do complain when it's a lie or when it's wrong.  But I have a strong temperament and it's a very good temperament and it's a very in control temperament or I wouldn't have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn't have built all of the things that I've been able to do in life. I mean, number one best-sellers, one of the best-selling books of all time, tremendous television success...[TAPPER]  I don't think anyone is... [TRUMP] I've been successful. Well, wait a minute, Jake. I've been successful in every business I've been in, if you think, real estate one of the most successful.  Uh, television, "The Apprentice," which is, forget it.  I mean NBC came to me.  They wanted to renew so badly you have no idea. [TAPPER]  But what does that have to do with temperament?...... [TRUMP] Oh, you can't have that success without good temperament. And I will say this.  I was thinking about the word temperament.  And we need a strong temperament in this country.  We have been led by weak people, weak ineffective people.  Countries have taken advantage of us, whether it's militarily or otherwise.  We have been taken advantage of by everybody.  We have people with weak temperaments. I have a very strong temperament.  But I have a temperament that's totally under control.  And, you know, you - she - she mentions that I'll bring us into war.  She's the one that wanted to go into Iraq.  I mean she raised her hand.  She didn't know what the hell she was doing.  She raised her hand. I said, I don't want to go into Iraq, Iraq is going to destabilize the Middle East and I was 100 percent right.”
 
 
Trump responds to criticism of judge with Mexican heritage “….[TRUMP] Do you know that these people went to every attorney general, practically, in the country that they could and do you know this case was turned down by almost every attorney general, from Texas to Florida to many of these states? [TAPPER]  Is it not, when Hillary Clinton says this is a racist attack and you reject that, if you are saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism? [TRUMP]  No, I don't think so at all. [TAPPER]  No? [TRUMP]  No.  He's proud of his heritage.  I - I respect him for that. [TAPPER]  But you're saying he can't do his job because of that. [TRUMP]  Look, he's proud of his heritage, OK.  I'm building a wall.  Now, I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. [TAPPER]  He's a legal citizen... [TRUMP]  You know why I'm going to do well with Hispanics? Because I'm going to bring back jobs and they're going to get jobs right now.  They're going to get jobs.  I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. But we're building a wall.  He's a Mexican.  We're building a wall between here and Mexico.  The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings, rulings that people can't even believe.  This case should have ended years ago on summary judgment.  The best lawyers - I have spoken to so many lawyers, they said this is not a case, this is a case that should have ended. [TAPPER]  I have... [TRUMP]  This judge is giving us unfair rulings. Now I say why? Well, I want to - I'm building a wall, OK, and it's a wall between Mexico, not another country...”

CNN to deliver comprehensive EU referendum coverage 
Multiplatform news, debate and analysis of UK’s crucial vote
London, 2 June 2016: As the UK prepares to vote on whether to remain in the European Union, CNN will offer a mix of special ‘Brexit’ programming to audiences around the world, across TV and digital platforms.
Leading up to the poll on 23 June, CNN’s most experienced journalists will be getting to grips with the issues facing UK voters, and the implications of their decision for Europe and the world.  The network will take to the UK’s roads, host an interactive debate show, and provide the latest news and reaction as the results come in.
Gill Penlington, Director of News & Event Programming, EMEA at CNN International, said: “There is so much information, misinformation, conjecture and opinion around this vitally important story.  We’ll be talking to leading lights from all angles of the debate, debunking some of the myths, and getting into the minds of the voters whose decision will have implications across the world.”
Following the story will be CNN journalists including anchors Hala Gorani, Max Foster, and Nina dos Santos, as well as Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson.  They will be joined by CNNMoney Editor at Large, Richard Quest, and Chief International Correspondent, Christiane Amanpour.
Key programming and content:
On digital:
Full coverage of the referendum can be found at CNN.com/Brexit – including explainers, opinion, and the very latest news.
On CNN International:
From Monday 13 June, Richard Quest will be taking to the UK’s roads in a 1970s campervan for a week, to get the mood on the ground.  Visiting iconic locations he will talk to voters, as well as leading voices from business, politics, academia and culture.  In addition to updates through the day on CNN International and extensive coverage on CNNMoney, Quest Means Business will also be anchored live from the campervan throughout the week at 9pm GMT/10pm CET.
On Thursday 16 June at 7pm BST/8pm CET, Christiane Amanpour will host an interactive ‘Brexit reality check’.  Recorded at the McLaren Thought Leadership Centre, UK Decides: In or Out will feature a panel of high profile guests from both sides of the debate. Max Foster will be marshalling the studio audience, who will use high tech, interactive voting technology to have their say in real time on the key issues.
On Thursday 23 June, the day of the referendum itself, CNN will present coverage throughout the day.  Then, from the moment the polls close, at 10pm GMT/11pm CET, there will be rolling coverage of the results.  Anchored live from London, with correspondents stationed in key locations in the UK and Europe, CNN will bring up-to-the-minute developments through the night as the votes are counted.  The result will then be dissected the next day, with the ramifications for the UK, Europe and the world put under the microscope.
ENDS

Update! Season Four Premiere of CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man Launches Friday, June 3, 10pm, ET/PT 
New Season Includes Spurlock’s Inside Look at Space, Gambling, Toxins, Disruptors, CSI and Gamers
Popular CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man, hosted and produced by the Oscar®-nominated documentary filmmaker, launches its fourth season on Friday, June 3 at 10pm ET/PT with an inside look at professional gambling.
In his inimitable, inquisitive style, and with a sense of humor intact, Spurlock tells compelling stories from an insider’s perspective. In the new season Morgan tackles toxins, gambling, the space industry, disruptors, gaming, and crime scene investigations.
The multiple award-winning program averaged 546,000 total viewers and 244,000 Adults 25-54 for premiere episodes in season three (1/22-3/19/15) and posted its highest season performance ever among both Adults 25-54 and total viewers. It surpassed its season two average (airing on Sundays at 10pm) by 7% in Adults 25-54 (228,000) and 27% in total viewers (429,000).*
For embeddable clips from the new season, please click on the following link:  http://www.cnn.com/shows/inside-man
Below are descriptions of Morgan Spurlock Inside Man season four episodes (airdates subject to change):
DOUBLE OR NOTHING (airdate June 3 2016)
Spurlock enters the seductive world of professional gambling by spending a week in Las Vegas determined to beat the house. His exploration of this pastime, which often leads to serious addiction, takes him to casinos, bookies, the racetrack, Off Track Betting and just about any place that allows him to gamble.
ONE GIANT STEP FOR MORGAN (airdate June 10, 2016)
Spurlock “virtually” experiences life as an astronaut and investigates the future of the space industry. The host’s journey takes him to government and private facilities including NASA’s Johnson Space Center (Houston), the X-Prize Foundation (Culver City, CA.) and Virgin Atlantic’s Mojave Air & Space Port (CA.) to see how the rules of the game are changing and what it means for the human race.
THE TRUTH ABOUT TOXINS  (airdate June 17, 2016)
In a quest to rid his life of contaminants – which are prominent in food, cleaning products and even furniture, Spurlock gets professional help to “de-tox.” The host puts his body to the test, dabbling in chelation therapy, infrared saunas, electromagnetic-free sleep chambers, and various cleanses, to see if poisons can truly be flushed out of our bodies and surroundings in the modern world.
CSI: SPURLOCK (airdate June 24, 2016)
Separating fact from TV dramatizations, Spurlock embeds in a forensic science unit to understand first-hand how crime scene investigations are actually conducted.  From the first responders, to the collection of evidence (at CSI Academy in Alachua, FL and ATF training facility in Huntsville, AL) and its analysis in the lab, he gets a crash course in Crime 101 from beginning to end.
GAME CHANGERS (airdate July 1, 2016)
Screaming fans, sold-out arenas, and teenage superstars, Spurlock joins the ranks of professional video gamers in one of the fastest-growing sectors of the “sports” world. Committed to understanding this shockingly intense industry, he joins reigning League of Legends North American Champions, from Counter Logic Gaming, as they train to compete for a big cash prize at the World Championship in Paris.
SEEK AND DISRUPT! (airdate July 8, 2016)
Inspired by companies like Google, AirBnB, and Spotify, Spurlock attempts to fill a void in the marketplace and re-write the rules by becoming the next disruptor. An eye-opening trip to Silicon Valley provides industry advice from tech giants, and examines why companies like Uber often leave a trail of enemies in their wake and questions whether this golden era of tech will solve age-old problems.

Meet CNN Digital's New VP of Programming: Mitra Kalita 
Meet Mitra Kalita. She’ll be making a big move from the left coast to the right to head up programming for CNN Digital in the coming weeks. Mitra joins CNN from the Los Angeles Times, where she is serving as the publication’s managing editor. Before that, she was the executive editor of Quartz. She’s also worked for the Wall Street Journal, Mint and the Washington Post.
In her new role as VP of Programming, Mitra will lead CNN Digital’s efforts to creatively share its journalism and storytelling across an ever-exploding array of platforms. She will oversee the News & Alerting, Special Projects, and Mobile & Off-Platform teams. Mitra will be based in the Big Apple and report to Editor-in-Chief Meredith Artley.
Since no one really likes press releases, we decided to mix things up with a Q&A. Read on and join us in welcoming Mitra to CNN: @MitraKalita.
What’s your guilty pleasure?
Chips. Uber. Bright tights. The Office. The TV show, not the place.
VP of Programming sounds like a TV title.  What does that mean for Digital?   
The success of our journalism rests on two important factors: how good is the story and how good is the distribution. How adaptive are we to different devices and different platforms? How accessible, relatable, intimate, authoritative? Technically, I will oversee the homepage, alerts, projects and planning, mobile news and off-platform partnerships and initiatives. But really, I see this job as one that collaborates across departments, time zones and mediums to maximize the reach of our journalism.
If you weren’t a journalist, what would you be doing?
I can’t think of anything else I’d rather do.

I’m excited to be able to share my journey and my stories with our audiences, both in the US and worldwide.”
“Hines is a true champion with such a winning personality,” said Bill Galvin, SVP, Sports Programming, CNN.  “His perspective on sports extends well beyond the football field – a fresh voice we’re excited to share with HLN and CNN audiences.”
Upon his retirement in 2012 from the NFL, where here he played for 14 years with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ward trained and completed the 2013 Ironman World Championships held annually in Hawaii. He began his television career as an analyst for NBC’s Sunday primetime NFL show, Football Night in America.
He founded and operates Helping Hands Foundations both in the U.S. and Korea, and is an active participant with numerous other charities including The Caring Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and Pearl S. Buck International. Ward also started an after-school education program for kids in his home state of Georgia, where he attended Forest Park High School and went on to be a top scholar-athlete at the University of Georgia, earning All-SEC honors his senior year and finishing his college career as Georgia's second all-time receiver with 144 receptions. He currently lives in Atlanta with his wife and son.
Ward is represented by CSE Talent, which offers management and career assistance to its elite roster of over 200 clients including pro and collegiate coaches, baseball players, golfers, management, and news and sport media talent.

Text Highlights
 
Trump on Clinton’s “thin skin” comment: “Well, first of all, I don't have thin skin, I have very, very strong, very thick skin.  And when somebody is right about me, I always - you know, if you do a report and it's not necessarily positive but you're right, I never complain. I do complain when it's a lie or when it's wrong.  But I have a strong temperament and it's a very good temperament and it's a very in control temperament or I wouldn't have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn't have built all of the things that I've been able to do in life. I mean, number one best-sellers, one of the best-selling books of all time, tremendous television success...[TAPPER]  I don't think anyone is... [TRUMP] I've been successful. Well, wait a minute, Jake. I've been successful in every business I've been in, if you think, real estate one of the most successful.  Uh, television, "The Apprentice," which is, forget it.  I mean NBC came to me.  They wanted to renew so badly you have no idea. [TAPPER]  But what does that have to do with temperament?...... [TRUMP] Oh, you can't have that success without good temperament. And I will say this.  I was thinking about the word temperament.  And we need a strong temperament in this country.  We have been led by weak people, weak ineffective people.  Countries have taken advantage of us, whether it's militarily or otherwise.  We have been taken advantage of by everybody.  We have people with weak temperaments. I have a very strong temperament.  But I have a temperament that's totally under control.  And, you know, you - she - she mentions that I'll bring us into war.  She's the one that wanted to go into Iraq.  I mean she raised her hand.  She didn't know what the hell she was doing.  She raised her hand. I said, I don't want to go into Iraq, Iraq is going to destabilize the Middle East and I was 100 percent right.”
 
 
Trump responds to criticism of judge with Mexican heritage “….[TRUMP] Do you know that these people went to every attorney general, practically, in the country that they could and do you know this case was turned down by almost every attorney general, from Texas to Florida to many of these states? [TAPPER]  Is it not, when Hillary Clinton says this is a racist attack and you reject that, if you are saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism? [TRUMP]  No, I don't think so at all. [TAPPER]  No? [TRUMP]  No.  He's proud of his heritage.  I - I respect him for that. [TAPPER]  But you're saying he can't do his job because of that. [TRUMP]  Look, he's proud of his heritage, OK.  I'm building a wall.  Now, I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. [TAPPER]  He's a legal citizen... [TRUMP]  You know why I'm going to do well with Hispanics? Because I'm going to bring back jobs and they're going to get jobs right now.  They're going to get jobs.  I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. But we're building a wall.  He's a Mexican.  We're building a wall between here and Mexico.  The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings, rulings that people can't even believe.  This case should have ended years ago on summary judgment.  The best lawyers - I have spoken to so many lawyers, they said this is not a case, this is a case that should have ended. [TAPPER]  I have... [TRUMP]  This judge is giving us unfair rulings. Now I say why? Well, I want to - I'm building a wall, OK, and it's a wall between Mexico, not another country...”

CNN to deliver comprehensive EU referendum coverage 
Multiplatform news, debate and analysis of UK’s crucial vote
London, 2 June 2016: As the UK prepares to vote on whether to remain in the European Union, CNN will offer a mix of special ‘Brexit’ programming to audiences around the world, across TV and digital platforms.
Leading up to the poll on 23 June, CNN’s most experienced journalists will be getting to grips with the issues facing UK voters, and the implications of their decision for Europe and the world.  The network will take to the UK’s roads, host an interactive debate show, and provide the latest news and reaction as the results come in.
Gill Penlington, Director of News & Event Programming, EMEA at CNN International, said: “There is so much information, misinformation, conjecture and opinion around this vitally important story.  We’ll be talking to leading lights from all angles of the debate, debunking some of the myths, and getting into the minds of the voters whose decision will have implications across the world.”
Following the story will be CNN journalists including anchors Hala Gorani, Max Foster, and Nina dos Santos, as well as Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson.  They will be joined by CNNMoney Editor at Large, Richard Quest, and Chief International Correspondent, Christiane Amanpour.
Key programming and content:
On digital:
Full coverage of the referendum can be found at CNN.com/Brexit – including explainers, opinion, and the very latest news.
On CNN International:
From Monday 13 June, Richard Quest will be taking to the UK’s roads in a 1970s campervan for a week, to get the mood on the ground.  Visiting iconic locations he will talk to voters, as well as leading voices from business, politics, academia and culture.  In addition to updates through the day on CNN International and extensive coverage on CNNMoney, Quest Means Business will also be anchored live from the campervan throughout the week at 9pm GMT/10pm CET.
On Thursday 16 June at 7pm BST/8pm CET, Christiane Amanpour will host an interactive ‘Brexit reality check’.  Recorded at the McLaren Thought Leadership Centre, UK Decides: In or Out will feature a panel of high profile guests from both sides of the debate. Max Foster will be marshalling the studio audience, who will use high tech, interactive voting technology to have their say in real time on the key issues.
On Thursday 23 June, the day of the referendum itself, CNN will present coverage throughout the day.  Then, from the moment the polls close, at 10pm GMT/11pm CET, there will be rolling coverage of the results.  Anchored live from London, with correspondents stationed in key locations in the UK and Europe, CNN will bring up-to-the-minute developments through the night as the votes are counted.  The result will then be dissected the next day, with the ramifications for the UK, Europe and the world put under the microscope.
ENDS

Popular CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man, hosted and produced by the Oscar®-nominated documentary filmmaker, launches its fourth season on Friday, June 3 at 10pm ET/PT with an inside look at professional gambling.
In his inimitable, inquisitive style, and with a sense of humor intact, Spurlock tells compelling stories from an insider’s perspective. In the new season Morgan tackles toxins, gambling, the space industry, disruptors, gaming, and crime scene investigations.
The multiple award-winning program averaged 546,000 total viewers and 244,000 Adults 25-54 for premiere episodes in season three (1/22-3/19/15) and posted its highest season performance ever among both Adults 25-54 and total viewers. It surpassed its season two average (airing on Sundays at 10pm) by 7% in Adults 25-54 (228,000) and 27% in total viewers (429,000).*
For embeddable clips from the new season, please click on the following link:  http://www.cnn.com/shows/inside-man
Below are descriptions of Morgan Spurlock Inside Man season four episodes (airdates subject to change):
DOUBLE OR NOTHING (airdate June 3 2016)
Spurlock enters the seductive world of professional gambling by spending a week in Las Vegas determined to beat the house. His exploration of this pastime, which often leads to serious addiction, takes him to casinos, bookies, the racetrack, Off Track Betting and just about any place that allows him to gamble.
ONE GIANT STEP FOR MORGAN (airdate June 10, 2016)
Spurlock “virtually” experiences life as an astronaut and investigates the future of the space industry. The host’s journey takes him to government and private facilities including NASA’s Johnson Space Center (Houston), the X-Prize Foundation (Culver City, CA.) and Virgin Atlantic’s Mojave Air & Space Port (CA.) to see how the rules of the game are changing and what it means for the human race.
THE TRUTH ABOUT TOXINS  (airdate June 17, 2016)
In a quest to rid his life of contaminants – which are prominent in food, cleaning products and even furniture, Spurlock gets professional help to “de-tox.” The host puts his body to the test, dabbling in chelation therapy, infrared saunas, electromagnetic-free sleep chambers, and various cleanses, to see if poisons can truly be flushed out of our bodies and surroundings in the modern world.
CSI: SPURLOCK (airdate June 24, 2016)
Separating fact from TV dramatizations, Spurlock embeds in a forensic science unit to understand first-hand how crime scene investigations are actually conducted.  From the first responders, to the collection of evidence (at CSI Academy in Alachua, FL and ATF training facility in Huntsville, AL) and its analysis in the lab, he gets a crash course in Crime 101 from beginning to end.
GAME CHANGERS (airdate July 1, 2016)
Screaming fans, sold-out arenas, and teenage superstars, Spurlock joins the ranks of professional video gamers in one of the fastest-growing sectors of the “sports” world. Committed to understanding this shockingly intense industry, he joins reigning League of Legends North American Champions, from Counter Logic Gaming, as they train to compete for a big cash prize at the World Championship in Paris.
SEEK AND DISRUPT! (airdate July 8, 2016)
Inspired by companies like Google, AirBnB, and Spotify, Spurlock attempts to fill a void in the marketplace and re-write the rules by becoming the next disruptor. An eye-opening trip to Silicon Valley provides industry advice from tech giants, and examines why companies like Uber often leave a trail of enemies in their wake and questions whether this golden era of tech will solve age-old problems.

She will oversee the News & Alerting, Special Projects, and Mobile & Off-Platform teams. Mitra will be based in the Big Apple and report to Editor-in-Chief Meredith Artley.
Since no one really likes press releases, we decided to mix things up with a Q&A. Read on and join us in welcoming Mitra to CNN: @MitraKalita.
What’s your guilty pleasure?
Chips. Uber. Bright tights. The Office. The TV show, not the place.
VP of Programming sounds like a TV title.  What does that mean for Digital?   
The success of our journalism rests on two important factors: how good is the story and how good is the distribution. How adaptive are we to different devices and different platforms? How accessible, relatable, intimate, authoritative? Technically, I will oversee the homepage, alerts, projects and planning, mobile news and off-platform partnerships and initiatives. But really, I see this job as one that collaborates across departments, time zones and mediums to maximize the reach of our journalism.
If you weren’t a journalist, what would you be doing?
I can’t think of anything else I’d rather do.

“I’m incredibly grateful to HLN and CNN for welcoming me to their prestigious team,” said Ward. “Throughout my career, I’ve always envisioned myself as more than just a football player and this platform will allow me to express myself in different and unique ways. I’m excited to be able to share my journey and my stories with our audiences, both in the US and worldwide.”
“Hines is a true champion with such a winning personality,” said Bill Galvin, SVP, Sports Programming, CNN.  “His perspective on sports extends well beyond the football field – a fresh voice we’re excited to share with HLN and CNN audiences.”
Upon his retirement in 2012 from the NFL, where here he played for 14 years with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ward trained and completed the 2013 Ironman World Championships held annually in Hawaii. He began his television career as an analyst for NBC’s Sunday primetime NFL show, Football Night in America.
He founded and operates Helping Hands Foundations both in the U.S. and Korea, and is an active participant with numerous other charities including The Caring Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and Pearl S. Buck International. Ward also started an after-school education program for kids in his home state of Georgia, where he attended Forest Park High School and went on to be a top scholar-athlete at the University of Georgia, earning All-SEC honors his senior year and finishing his college career as Georgia's second all-time receiver with 144 receptions. He currently lives in Atlanta with his wife and son.
Ward is represented by CSE Talent, which offers management and career assistance to its elite roster of over 200 clients including pro and collegiate coaches, baseball players, golfers, management, and news and sport media talent.

CNN Story: 
Trump defends criticism of judge with Mexican heritage
 
Text Highlights
 
Trump on Clinton’s “thin skin” comment: “Well, first of all, I don't have thin skin, I have very, very strong, very thick skin.  And when somebody is right about me, I always - you know, if you do a report and it's not necessarily positive but you're right, I never complain. I do complain when it's a lie or when it's wrong.  But I have a strong temperament and it's a very good temperament and it's a very in control temperament or I wouldn't have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn't have built all of the things that I've been able to do in life. I mean, number one best-sellers, one of the best-selling books of all time, tremendous television success...[TAPPER]  I don't think anyone is... [TRUMP] I've been successful. Well, wait a minute, Jake. I've been successful in every business I've been in, if you think, real estate one of the most successful.  Uh, television, "The Apprentice," which is, forget it.  I mean NBC came to me.  They wanted to renew so badly you have no idea. [TAPPER]  But what does that have to do with temperament?...... [TRUMP] Oh, you can't have that success without good temperament. And I will say this.  I was thinking about the word temperament.  And we need a strong temperament in this country.  We have been led by weak people, weak ineffective people.  Countries have taken advantage of us, whether it's militarily or otherwise.  We have been taken advantage of by everybody.  We have people with weak temperaments. I have a very strong temperament.  But I have a temperament that's totally under control.  And, you know, you - she - she mentions that I'll bring us into war.  She's the one that wanted to go into Iraq.  I mean she raised her hand.  She didn't know what the hell she was doing.  She raised her hand. I said, I don't want to go into Iraq, Iraq is going to destabilize the Middle East and I was 100 percent right.”
 
 
Trump responds to criticism of judge with Mexican heritage “….[TRUMP] Do you know that these people went to every attorney general, practically, in the country that they could and do you know this case was turned down by almost every attorney general, from Texas to Florida to many of these states? [TAPPER]  Is it not, when Hillary Clinton says this is a racist attack and you reject that, if you are saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism? [TRUMP]  No, I don't think so at all. [TAPPER]  No? [TRUMP]  No.  He's proud of his heritage.  I - I respect him for that. [TAPPER]  But you're saying he can't do his job because of that. [TRUMP]  Look, he's proud of his heritage, OK.  I'm building a wall.  Now, I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. [TAPPER]  He's a legal citizen... [TRUMP]  You know why I'm going to do well with Hispanics? Because I'm going to bring back jobs and they're going to get jobs right now.  They're going to get jobs.  I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. But we're building a wall.  He's a Mexican.  We're building a wall between here and Mexico.  The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings, rulings that people can't even believe.  This case should have ended years ago on summary judgment.  The best lawyers - I have spoken to so many lawyers, they said this is not a case, this is a case that should have ended. [TAPPER]  I have... [TRUMP]  This judge is giving us unfair rulings. Now I say why? Well, I want to - I'm building a wall, OK, and it's a wall between Mexico, not another country...”

CNN to deliver comprehensive EU referendum coverage 
Multiplatform news, debate and analysis of UK’s crucial vote
London, 2 June 2016: As the UK prepares to vote on whether to remain in the European Union, CNN will offer a mix of special ‘Brexit’ programming to audiences around the world, across TV and digital platforms.
Leading up to the poll on 23 June, CNN’s most experienced journalists will be getting to grips with the issues facing UK voters, and the implications of their decision for Europe and the world.  The network will take to the UK’s roads, host an interactive debate show, and provide the latest news and reaction as the results come in.
Gill Penlington, Director of News & Event Programming, EMEA at CNN International, said: “There is so much information, misinformation, conjecture and opinion around this vitally important story.  We’ll be talking to leading lights from all angles of the debate, debunking some of the myths, and getting into the minds of the voters whose decision will have implications across the world.”
Following the story will be CNN journalists including anchors Hala Gorani, Max Foster, and Nina dos Santos, as well as Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson.  They will be joined by CNNMoney Editor at Large, Richard Quest, and Chief International Correspondent, Christiane Amanpour.
Key programming and content:
On digital:
Full coverage of the referendum can be found at CNN.com/Brexit – including explainers, opinion, and the very latest news.
On CNN International:
From Monday 13 June, Richard Quest will be taking to the UK’s roads in a 1970s campervan for a week, to get the mood on the ground.  Visiting iconic locations he will talk to voters, as well as leading voices from business, politics, academia and culture.  In addition to updates through the day on CNN International and extensive coverage on CNNMoney, Quest Means Business will also be anchored live from the campervan throughout the week at 9pm GMT/10pm CET.
On Thursday 16 June at 7pm BST/8pm CET, Christiane Amanpour will host an interactive ‘Brexit reality check’.  Recorded at the McLaren Thought Leadership Centre, UK Decides: In or Out will feature a panel of high profile guests from both sides of the debate. Max Foster will be marshalling the studio audience, who will use high tech, interactive voting technology to have their say in real time on the key issues.
On Thursday 23 June, the day of the referendum itself, CNN will present coverage throughout the day.  Then, from the moment the polls close, at 10pm GMT/11pm CET, there will be rolling coverage of the results.  Anchored live from London, with correspondents stationed in key locations in the UK and Europe, CNN will bring up-to-the-minute developments through the night as the votes are counted.  The result will then be dissected the next day, with the ramifications for the UK, Europe and the world put under the microscope.
ENDS

Update! Season Four Premiere of CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man Launches Friday, June 3, 10pm, ET/PT 
New Season Includes Spurlock’s Inside Look at Space, Gambling, Toxins, Disruptors, CSI and Gamers
Popular CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man, hosted and produced by the Oscar®-nominated documentary filmmaker, launches its fourth season on Friday, June 3 at 10pm ET/PT with an inside look at professional gambling.
In his inimitable, inquisitive style, and with a sense of humor intact, Spurlock tells compelling stories from an insider’s perspective. In the new season Morgan tackles toxins, gambling, the space industry, disruptors, gaming, and crime scene investigations.
The multiple award-winning program averaged 546,000 total viewers and 244,000 Adults 25-54 for premiere episodes in season three (1/22-3/19/15) and posted its highest season performance ever among both Adults 25-54 and total viewers. It surpassed its season two average (airing on Sundays at 10pm) by 7% in Adults 25-54 (228,000) and 27% in total viewers (429,000).*
For embeddable clips from the new season, please click on the following link:  http://www.cnn.com/shows/inside-man
Below are descriptions of Morgan Spurlock Inside Man season four episodes (airdates subject to change):
DOUBLE OR NOTHING (airdate June 3 2016)
Spurlock enters the seductive world of professional gambling by spending a week in Las Vegas determined to beat the house. His exploration of this pastime, which often leads to serious addiction, takes him to casinos, bookies, the racetrack, Off Track Betting and just about any place that allows him to gamble.
ONE GIANT STEP FOR MORGAN (airdate June 10, 2016)
Spurlock “virtually” experiences life as an astronaut and investigates the future of the space industry. The host’s journey takes him to government and private facilities including NASA’s Johnson Space Center (Houston), the X-Prize Foundation (Culver City, CA.) and Virgin Atlantic’s Mojave Air & Space Port (CA.) to see how the rules of the game are changing and what it means for the human race.
THE TRUTH ABOUT TOXINS  (airdate June 17, 2016)
In a quest to rid his life of contaminants – which are prominent in food, cleaning products and even furniture, Spurlock gets professional help to “de-tox.” The host puts his body to the test, dabbling in chelation therapy, infrared saunas, electromagnetic-free sleep chambers, and various cleanses, to see if poisons can truly be flushed out of our bodies and surroundings in the modern world.
CSI: SPURLOCK (airdate June 24, 2016)
Separating fact from TV dramatizations, Spurlock embeds in a forensic science unit to understand first-hand how crime scene investigations are actually conducted.  From the first responders, to the collection of evidence (at CSI Academy in Alachua, FL and ATF training facility in Huntsville, AL) and its analysis in the lab, he gets a crash course in Crime 101 from beginning to end.
GAME CHANGERS (airdate July 1, 2016)
Screaming fans, sold-out arenas, and teenage superstars, Spurlock joins the ranks of professional video gamers in one of the fastest-growing sectors of the “sports” world. Committed to understanding this shockingly intense industry, he joins reigning League of Legends North American Champions, from Counter Logic Gaming, as they train to compete for a big cash prize at the World Championship in Paris.
SEEK AND DISRUPT! (airdate July 8, 2016)
Inspired by companies like Google, AirBnB, and Spotify, Spurlock attempts to fill a void in the marketplace and re-write the rules by becoming the next disruptor. An eye-opening trip to Silicon Valley provides industry advice from tech giants, and examines why companies like Uber often leave a trail of enemies in their wake and questions whether this golden era of tech will solve age-old problems.

Meet CNN Digital's New VP of Programming: Mitra Kalita 
Meet Mitra Kalita. She’ll be making a big move from the left coast to the right to head up programming for CNN Digital in the coming weeks. Mitra joins CNN from the Los Angeles Times, where she is serving as the publication’s managing editor. Before that, she was the executive editor of Quartz. She’s also worked for the Wall Street Journal, Mint and the Washington Post.
In her new role as VP of Programming, Mitra will lead CNN Digital’s efforts to creatively share its journalism and storytelling across an ever-exploding array of platforms. She will oversee the News & Alerting, Special Projects, and Mobile & Off-Platform teams. Mitra will be based in the Big Apple and report to Editor-in-Chief Meredith Artley.
Since no one really likes press releases, we decided to mix things up with a Q&A. Read on and join us in welcoming Mitra to CNN: @MitraKalita.
What’s your guilty pleasure?
Chips. Uber. Bright tights. The Office. The TV show, not the place.
VP of Programming sounds like a TV title.  What does that mean for Digital?   
The success of our journalism rests on two important factors: how good is the story and how good is the distribution. How adaptive are we to different devices and different platforms? How accessible, relatable, intimate, authoritative? Technically, I will oversee the homepage, alerts, projects and planning, mobile news and off-platform partnerships and initiatives. But really, I see this job as one that collaborates across departments, time zones and mediums to maximize the reach of our journalism.
If you weren’t a journalist, what would you be doing?
I can’t think of anything else I’d rather do.

Ward to Also Provide Sports Commentary and Analysis Across all CNN Platforms

I’m excited to be able to share my journey and my stories with our audiences, both in the US and worldwide.”
“Hines is a true champion with such a winning personality,” said Bill Galvin, SVP, Sports Programming, CNN.  “His perspective on sports extends well beyond the football field – a fresh voice we’re excited to share with HLN and CNN audiences.”
Upon his retirement in 2012 from the NFL, where here he played for 14 years with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ward trained and completed the 2013 Ironman World Championships held annually in Hawaii. He began his television career as an analyst for NBC’s Sunday primetime NFL show, Football Night in America.
He founded and operates Helping Hands Foundations both in the U.S. and Korea, and is an active participant with numerous other charities including The Caring Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and Pearl S. Buck International. Ward also started an after-school education program for kids in his home state of Georgia, where he attended Forest Park High School and went on to be a top scholar-athlete at the University of Georgia, earning All-SEC honors his senior year and finishing his college career as Georgia's second all-time receiver with 144 receptions. He currently lives in Atlanta with his wife and son.
Ward is represented by CSE Talent, which offers management and career assistance to its elite roster of over 200 clients including pro and collegiate coaches, baseball players, golfers, management, and news and sport media talent.

Text Highlights
 
Trump on Clinton’s “thin skin” comment: “Well, first of all, I don't have thin skin, I have very, very strong, very thick skin.  And when somebody is right about me, I always - you know, if you do a report and it's not necessarily positive but you're right, I never complain. I do complain when it's a lie or when it's wrong.  But I have a strong temperament and it's a very good temperament and it's a very in control temperament or I wouldn't have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn't have built all of the things that I've been able to do in life. I mean, number one best-sellers, one of the best-selling books of all time, tremendous television success...[TAPPER]  I don't think anyone is... [TRUMP] I've been successful. Well, wait a minute, Jake. I've been successful in every business I've been in, if you think, real estate one of the most successful.  Uh, television, "The Apprentice," which is, forget it.  I mean NBC came to me.  They wanted to renew so badly you have no idea. [TAPPER]  But what does that have to do with temperament?...... [TRUMP] Oh, you can't have that success without good temperament. And I will say this.  I was thinking about the word temperament.  And we need a strong temperament in this country.  We have been led by weak people, weak ineffective people.  Countries have taken advantage of us, whether it's militarily or otherwise.  We have been taken advantage of by everybody.  We have people with weak temperaments. I have a very strong temperament.  But I have a temperament that's totally under control.  And, you know, you - she - she mentions that I'll bring us into war.  She's the one that wanted to go into Iraq.  I mean she raised her hand.  She didn't know what the hell she was doing.  She raised her hand. I said, I don't want to go into Iraq, Iraq is going to destabilize the Middle East and I was 100 percent right.”
 
 
Trump responds to criticism of judge with Mexican heritage “….[TRUMP] Do you know that these people went to every attorney general, practically, in the country that they could and do you know this case was turned down by almost every attorney general, from Texas to Florida to many of these states? [TAPPER]  Is it not, when Hillary Clinton says this is a racist attack and you reject that, if you are saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism? [TRUMP]  No, I don't think so at all. [TAPPER]  No? [TRUMP]  No.  He's proud of his heritage.  I - I respect him for that. [TAPPER]  But you're saying he can't do his job because of that. [TRUMP]  Look, he's proud of his heritage, OK.  I'm building a wall.  Now, I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. [TAPPER]  He's a legal citizen... [TRUMP]  You know why I'm going to do well with Hispanics? Because I'm going to bring back jobs and they're going to get jobs right now.  They're going to get jobs.  I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. But we're building a wall.  He's a Mexican.  We're building a wall between here and Mexico.  The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings, rulings that people can't even believe.  This case should have ended years ago on summary judgment.  The best lawyers - I have spoken to so many lawyers, they said this is not a case, this is a case that should have ended. [TAPPER]  I have... [TRUMP]  This judge is giving us unfair rulings. Now I say why? Well, I want to - I'm building a wall, OK, and it's a wall between Mexico, not another country...”

CNN to deliver comprehensive EU referendum coverage 
Multiplatform news, debate and analysis of UK’s crucial vote
London, 2 June 2016: As the UK prepares to vote on whether to remain in the European Union, CNN will offer a mix of special ‘Brexit’ programming to audiences around the world, across TV and digital platforms.
Leading up to the poll on 23 June, CNN’s most experienced journalists will be getting to grips with the issues facing UK voters, and the implications of their decision for Europe and the world.  The network will take to the UK’s roads, host an interactive debate show, and provide the latest news and reaction as the results come in.
Gill Penlington, Director of News & Event Programming, EMEA at CNN International, said: “There is so much information, misinformation, conjecture and opinion around this vitally important story.  We’ll be talking to leading lights from all angles of the debate, debunking some of the myths, and getting into the minds of the voters whose decision will have implications across the world.”
Following the story will be CNN journalists including anchors Hala Gorani, Max Foster, and Nina dos Santos, as well as Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson.  They will be joined by CNNMoney Editor at Large, Richard Quest, and Chief International Correspondent, Christiane Amanpour.
Key programming and content:
On digital:
Full coverage of the referendum can be found at CNN.com/Brexit – including explainers, opinion, and the very latest news.
On CNN International:
From Monday 13 June, Richard Quest will be taking to the UK’s roads in a 1970s campervan for a week, to get the mood on the ground.  Visiting iconic locations he will talk to voters, as well as leading voices from business, politics, academia and culture.  In addition to updates through the day on CNN International and extensive coverage on CNNMoney, Quest Means Business will also be anchored live from the campervan throughout the week at 9pm GMT/10pm CET.
On Thursday 16 June at 7pm BST/8pm CET, Christiane Amanpour will host an interactive ‘Brexit reality check’.  Recorded at the McLaren Thought Leadership Centre, UK Decides: In or Out will feature a panel of high profile guests from both sides of the debate. Max Foster will be marshalling the studio audience, who will use high tech, interactive voting technology to have their say in real time on the key issues.
On Thursday 23 June, the day of the referendum itself, CNN will present coverage throughout the day.  Then, from the moment the polls close, at 10pm GMT/11pm CET, there will be rolling coverage of the results.  Anchored live from London, with correspondents stationed in key locations in the UK and Europe, CNN will bring up-to-the-minute developments through the night as the votes are counted.  The result will then be dissected the next day, with the ramifications for the UK, Europe and the world put under the microscope.
ENDS

Popular CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man, hosted and produced by the Oscar®-nominated documentary filmmaker, launches its fourth season on Friday, June 3 at 10pm ET/PT with an inside look at professional gambling.
In his inimitable, inquisitive style, and with a sense of humor intact, Spurlock tells compelling stories from an insider’s perspective. In the new season Morgan tackles toxins, gambling, the space industry, disruptors, gaming, and crime scene investigations.
The multiple award-winning program averaged 546,000 total viewers and 244,000 Adults 25-54 for premiere episodes in season three (1/22-3/19/15) and posted its highest season performance ever among both Adults 25-54 and total viewers. It surpassed its season two average (airing on Sundays at 10pm) by 7% in Adults 25-54 (228,000) and 27% in total viewers (429,000).*
For embeddable clips from the new season, please click on the following link:  http://www.cnn.com/shows/inside-man
Below are descriptions of Morgan Spurlock Inside Man season four episodes (airdates subject to change):
DOUBLE OR NOTHING (airdate June 3 2016)
Spurlock enters the seductive world of professional gambling by spending a week in Las Vegas determined to beat the house. His exploration of this pastime, which often leads to serious addiction, takes him to casinos, bookies, the racetrack, Off Track Betting and just about any place that allows him to gamble.
ONE GIANT STEP FOR MORGAN (airdate June 10, 2016)
Spurlock “virtually” experiences life as an astronaut and investigates the future of the space industry. The host’s journey takes him to government and private facilities including NASA’s Johnson Space Center (Houston), the X-Prize Foundation (Culver City, CA.) and Virgin Atlantic’s Mojave Air & Space Port (CA.) to see how the rules of the game are changing and what it means for the human race.
THE TRUTH ABOUT TOXINS  (airdate June 17, 2016)
In a quest to rid his life of contaminants – which are prominent in food, cleaning products and even furniture, Spurlock gets professional help to “de-tox.” The host puts his body to the test, dabbling in chelation therapy, infrared saunas, electromagnetic-free sleep chambers, and various cleanses, to see if poisons can truly be flushed out of our bodies and surroundings in the modern world.
CSI: SPURLOCK (airdate June 24, 2016)
Separating fact from TV dramatizations, Spurlock embeds in a forensic science unit to understand first-hand how crime scene investigations are actually conducted.  From the first responders, to the collection of evidence (at CSI Academy in Alachua, FL and ATF training facility in Huntsville, AL) and its analysis in the lab, he gets a crash course in Crime 101 from beginning to end.
GAME CHANGERS (airdate July 1, 2016)
Screaming fans, sold-out arenas, and teenage superstars, Spurlock joins the ranks of professional video gamers in one of the fastest-growing sectors of the “sports” world. Committed to understanding this shockingly intense industry, he joins reigning League of Legends North American Champions, from Counter Logic Gaming, as they train to compete for a big cash prize at the World Championship in Paris.
SEEK AND DISRUPT! (airdate July 8, 2016)
Inspired by companies like Google, AirBnB, and Spotify, Spurlock attempts to fill a void in the marketplace and re-write the rules by becoming the next disruptor. An eye-opening trip to Silicon Valley provides industry advice from tech giants, and examines why companies like Uber often leave a trail of enemies in their wake and questions whether this golden era of tech will solve age-old problems.

Meet CNN Digital's New VP of Programming: Mitra Kalita 
Meet Mitra Kalita. She’ll be making a big move from the left coast to the right to head up programming for CNN Digital in the coming weeks. Mitra joins CNN from the Los Angeles Times, where she is serving as the publication’s managing editor. Before that, she was the executive editor of Quartz. She’s also worked for the Wall Street Journal, Mint and the Washington Post.
In her new role as VP of Programming, Mitra will lead CNN Digital’s efforts to creatively share its journalism and storytelling across an ever-exploding array of platforms. She will oversee the News & Alerting, Special Projects, and Mobile & Off-Platform teams. Mitra will be based in the Big Apple and report to Editor-in-Chief Meredith Artley.
Since no one really likes press releases, we decided to mix things up with a Q&A. Read on and join us in welcoming Mitra to CNN: @MitraKalita.
What’s your guilty pleasure?
Chips. Uber. Bright tights. The Office. The TV show, not the place.
VP of Programming sounds like a TV title.  What does that mean for Digital?   
The success of our journalism rests on two important factors: how good is the story and how good is the distribution. How adaptive are we to different devices and different platforms? How accessible, relatable, intimate, authoritative? Technically, I will oversee the homepage, alerts, projects and planning, mobile news and off-platform partnerships and initiatives. But really, I see this job as one that collaborates across departments, time zones and mediums to maximize the reach of our journalism.
If you weren’t a journalist, what would you be doing?
I can’t think of anything else I’d rather do.

TWO-TIME SUPER BOWL CHAMP AND 'DANCING WITH THE STARS' MIRRORBALL WINNER HINES WARD JOINS HLN’S 'MORNING EXPRESS WITH ROBIN MEADE' AS SPORTS CONTRIBUTOR
Ward to Also Provide Sports Commentary and Analysis Across all CNN Platforms
Hines Ward, two-time Super Bowl champion and Dancing with the Stars Mirrorball trophy winner, joins HLN’s Morning Express with Robin Meade as sports contributor.  Based at the network’s headquarters in Atlanta, Ward will also provide analysis and commentary on major sporting events and breaking news across all CNN platforms, including CNN/U.S., CNN Digital, CNNMoney and CNN International.
Beginning July 1, the Super Bowl XL MVP, joins the popular HLN morning crew of host Robin Meade, meteorologist Bob Van Dillen and consumer business correspondent Jennifer Westhoven. Morning Express with Robin Meade is a ratings juggernaut for the network.  The wildly successful morning show is up double-digits year-to-date in both total viewers and persons 25-54.
“I’m incredibly grateful to HLN and CNN for welcoming me to their prestigious team,” said Ward. “Throughout my career, I’ve always envisioned myself as more than just a football player and this platform will allow me to express myself in different and unique ways. I’m excited to be able to share my journey and my stories with our audiences, both in the US and worldwide.”
“Hines is a true champion with such a winning personality,” said Bill Galvin, SVP, Sports Programming, CNN.  “His perspective on sports extends well beyond the football field – a fresh voice we’re excited to share with HLN and CNN audiences.”
Upon his retirement in 2012 from the NFL, where here he played for 14 years with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ward trained and completed the 2013 Ironman World Championships held annually in Hawaii. He began his television career as an analyst for NBC’s Sunday primetime NFL show, Football Night in America.
He founded and operates Helping Hands Foundations both in the U.S. and Korea, and is an active participant with numerous other charities including The Caring Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and Pearl S. Buck International. Ward also started an after-school education program for kids in his home state of Georgia, where he attended Forest Park High School and went on to be a top scholar-athlete at the University of Georgia, earning All-SEC honors his senior year and finishing his college career as Georgia's second all-time receiver with 144 receptions. He currently lives in Atlanta with his wife and son.
Ward is represented by CSE Talent, which offers management and career assistance to its elite roster of over 200 clients including pro and collegiate coaches, baseball players, golfers, management, and news and sport media talent.

CNN Story: 
Trump defends criticism of judge with Mexican heritage
 
Text Highlights
 
Trump on Clinton’s “thin skin” comment: “Well, first of all, I don't have thin skin, I have very, very strong, very thick skin.  And when somebody is right about me, I always - you know, if you do a report and it's not necessarily positive but you're right, I never complain. I do complain when it's a lie or when it's wrong.  But I have a strong temperament and it's a very good temperament and it's a very in control temperament or I wouldn't have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn't have built all of the things that I've been able to do in life. I mean, number one best-sellers, one of the best-selling books of all time, tremendous television success...[TAPPER]  I don't think anyone is... [TRUMP] I've been successful. Well, wait a minute, Jake. I've been successful in every business I've been in, if you think, real estate one of the most successful.  Uh, television, "The Apprentice," which is, forget it.  I mean NBC came to me.  They wanted to renew so badly you have no idea. [TAPPER]  But what does that have to do with temperament?...... [TRUMP] Oh, you can't have that success without good temperament. And I will say this.  I was thinking about the word temperament.  And we need a strong temperament in this country.  We have been led by weak people, weak ineffective people.  Countries have taken advantage of us, whether it's militarily or otherwise.  We have been taken advantage of by everybody.  We have people with weak temperaments. I have a very strong temperament.  But I have a temperament that's totally under control.  And, you know, you - she - she mentions that I'll bring us into war.  She's the one that wanted to go into Iraq.  I mean she raised her hand.  She didn't know what the hell she was doing.  She raised her hand. I said, I don't want to go into Iraq, Iraq is going to destabilize the Middle East and I was 100 percent right.”
 
 
Trump responds to criticism of judge with Mexican heritage “….[TRUMP] Do you know that these people went to every attorney general, practically, in the country that they could and do you know this case was turned down by almost every attorney general, from Texas to Florida to many of these states? [TAPPER]  Is it not, when Hillary Clinton says this is a racist attack and you reject that, if you are saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism? [TRUMP]  No, I don't think so at all. [TAPPER]  No? [TRUMP]  No.  He's proud of his heritage.  I - I respect him for that. [TAPPER]  But you're saying he can't do his job because of that. [TRUMP]  Look, he's proud of his heritage, OK.  I'm building a wall.  Now, I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. [TAPPER]  He's a legal citizen... [TRUMP]  You know why I'm going to do well with Hispanics? Because I'm going to bring back jobs and they're going to get jobs right now.  They're going to get jobs.  I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. But we're building a wall.  He's a Mexican.  We're building a wall between here and Mexico.  The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings, rulings that people can't even believe.  This case should have ended years ago on summary judgment.  The best lawyers - I have spoken to so many lawyers, they said this is not a case, this is a case that should have ended. [TAPPER]  I have... [TRUMP]  This judge is giving us unfair rulings. Now I say why? Well, I want to - I'm building a wall, OK, and it's a wall between Mexico, not another country...”

CNN to deliver comprehensive EU referendum coverage 
Multiplatform news, debate and analysis of UK’s crucial vote
London, 2 June 2016: As the UK prepares to vote on whether to remain in the European Union, CNN will offer a mix of special ‘Brexit’ programming to audiences around the world, across TV and digital platforms.
Leading up to the poll on 23 June, CNN’s most experienced journalists will be getting to grips with the issues facing UK voters, and the implications of their decision for Europe and the world.  The network will take to the UK’s roads, host an interactive debate show, and provide the latest news and reaction as the results come in.
Gill Penlington, Director of News & Event Programming, EMEA at CNN International, said: “There is so much information, misinformation, conjecture and opinion around this vitally important story.  We’ll be talking to leading lights from all angles of the debate, debunking some of the myths, and getting into the minds of the voters whose decision will have implications across the world.”
Following the story will be CNN journalists including anchors Hala Gorani, Max Foster, and Nina dos Santos, as well as Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson.  They will be joined by CNNMoney Editor at Large, Richard Quest, and Chief International Correspondent, Christiane Amanpour.
Key programming and content:
On digital:
Full coverage of the referendum can be found at CNN.com/Brexit – including explainers, opinion, and the very latest news.
On CNN International:
From Monday 13 June, Richard Quest will be taking to the UK’s roads in a 1970s campervan for a week, to get the mood on the ground.  Visiting iconic locations he will talk to voters, as well as leading voices from business, politics, academia and culture.  In addition to updates through the day on CNN International and extensive coverage on CNNMoney, Quest Means Business will also be anchored live from the campervan throughout the week at 9pm GMT/10pm CET.
On Thursday 16 June at 7pm BST/8pm CET, Christiane Amanpour will host an interactive ‘Brexit reality check’.  Recorded at the McLaren Thought Leadership Centre, UK Decides: In or Out will feature a panel of high profile guests from both sides of the debate. Max Foster will be marshalling the studio audience, who will use high tech, interactive voting technology to have their say in real time on the key issues.
On Thursday 23 June, the day of the referendum itself, CNN will present coverage throughout the day.  Then, from the moment the polls close, at 10pm GMT/11pm CET, there will be rolling coverage of the results.  Anchored live from London, with correspondents stationed in key locations in the UK and Europe, CNN will bring up-to-the-minute developments through the night as the votes are counted.  The result will then be dissected the next day, with the ramifications for the UK, Europe and the world put under the microscope.
ENDS

Update! Season Four Premiere of CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man Launches Friday, June 3, 10pm, ET/PT 
New Season Includes Spurlock’s Inside Look at Space, Gambling, Toxins, Disruptors, CSI and Gamers
Popular CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man, hosted and produced by the Oscar®-nominated documentary filmmaker, launches its fourth season on Friday, June 3 at 10pm ET/PT with an inside look at professional gambling.
In his inimitable, inquisitive style, and with a sense of humor intact, Spurlock tells compelling stories from an insider’s perspective. In the new season Morgan tackles toxins, gambling, the space industry, disruptors, gaming, and crime scene investigations.
The multiple award-winning program averaged 546,000 total viewers and 244,000 Adults 25-54 for premiere episodes in season three (1/22-3/19/15) and posted its highest season performance ever among both Adults 25-54 and total viewers. It surpassed its season two average (airing on Sundays at 10pm) by 7% in Adults 25-54 (228,000) and 27% in total viewers (429,000).*
For embeddable clips from the new season, please click on the following link:  http://www.cnn.com/shows/inside-man
Below are descriptions of Morgan Spurlock Inside Man season four episodes (airdates subject to change):
DOUBLE OR NOTHING (airdate June 3 2016)
Spurlock enters the seductive world of professional gambling by spending a week in Las Vegas determined to beat the house. His exploration of this pastime, which often leads to serious addiction, takes him to casinos, bookies, the racetrack, Off Track Betting and just about any place that allows him to gamble.
ONE GIANT STEP FOR MORGAN (airdate June 10, 2016)
Spurlock “virtually” experiences life as an astronaut and investigates the future of the space industry. The host’s journey takes him to government and private facilities including NASA’s Johnson Space Center (Houston), the X-Prize Foundation (Culver City, CA.) and Virgin Atlantic’s Mojave Air & Space Port (CA.) to see how the rules of the game are changing and what it means for the human race.
THE TRUTH ABOUT TOXINS  (airdate June 17, 2016)
In a quest to rid his life of contaminants – which are prominent in food, cleaning products and even furniture, Spurlock gets professional help to “de-tox.” The host puts his body to the test, dabbling in chelation therapy, infrared saunas, electromagnetic-free sleep chambers, and various cleanses, to see if poisons can truly be flushed out of our bodies and surroundings in the modern world.
CSI: SPURLOCK (airdate June 24, 2016)
Separating fact from TV dramatizations, Spurlock embeds in a forensic science unit to understand first-hand how crime scene investigations are actually conducted.  From the first responders, to the collection of evidence (at CSI Academy in Alachua, FL and ATF training facility in Huntsville, AL) and its analysis in the lab, he gets a crash course in Crime 101 from beginning to end.
GAME CHANGERS (airdate July 1, 2016)
Screaming fans, sold-out arenas, and teenage superstars, Spurlock joins the ranks of professional video gamers in one of the fastest-growing sectors of the “sports” world. Committed to understanding this shockingly intense industry, he joins reigning League of Legends North American Champions, from Counter Logic Gaming, as they train to compete for a big cash prize at the World Championship in Paris.
SEEK AND DISRUPT! (airdate July 8, 2016)
Inspired by companies like Google, AirBnB, and Spotify, Spurlock attempts to fill a void in the marketplace and re-write the rules by becoming the next disruptor. An eye-opening trip to Silicon Valley provides industry advice from tech giants, and examines why companies like Uber often leave a trail of enemies in their wake and questions whether this golden era of tech will solve age-old problems.

Meet CNN Digital's New VP of Programming: Mitra Kalita 
Meet Mitra Kalita. She’ll be making a big move from the left coast to the right to head up programming for CNN Digital in the coming weeks. Mitra joins CNN from the Los Angeles Times, where she is serving as the publication’s managing editor. Before that, she was the executive editor of Quartz. She’s also worked for the Wall Street Journal, Mint and the Washington Post.
In her new role as VP of Programming, Mitra will lead CNN Digital’s efforts to creatively share its journalism and storytelling across an ever-exploding array of platforms. She will oversee the News & Alerting, Special Projects, and Mobile & Off-Platform teams. Mitra will be based in the Big Apple and report to Editor-in-Chief Meredith Artley.
Since no one really likes press releases, we decided to mix things up with a Q&A. Read on and join us in welcoming Mitra to CNN: @MitraKalita.
What’s your guilty pleasure?
Chips. Uber. Bright tights. The Office. The TV show, not the place.
VP of Programming sounds like a TV title.  What does that mean for Digital?   
The success of our journalism rests on two important factors: how good is the story and how good is the distribution. How adaptive are we to different devices and different platforms? How accessible, relatable, intimate, authoritative? Technically, I will oversee the homepage, alerts, projects and planning, mobile news and off-platform partnerships and initiatives. But really, I see this job as one that collaborates across departments, time zones and mediums to maximize the reach of our journalism.
If you weren’t a journalist, what would you be doing?
I can’t think of anything else I’d rather do.

Ward to Also Provide Sports Commentary and Analysis Across all CNN Platforms

“I’m incredibly grateful to HLN and CNN for welcoming me to their prestigious team,” said Ward. “Throughout my career, I’ve always envisioned myself as more than just a football player and this platform will allow me to express myself in different and unique ways. I’m excited to be able to share my journey and my stories with our audiences, both in the US and worldwide.”
“Hines is a true champion with such a winning personality,” said Bill Galvin, SVP, Sports Programming, CNN.  “His perspective on sports extends well beyond the football field – a fresh voice we’re excited to share with HLN and CNN audiences.”
Upon his retirement in 2012 from the NFL, where here he played for 14 years with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ward trained and completed the 2013 Ironman World Championships held annually in Hawaii. He began his television career as an analyst for NBC’s Sunday primetime NFL show, Football Night in America.
He founded and operates Helping Hands Foundations both in the U.S. and Korea, and is an active participant with numerous other charities including The Caring Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and Pearl S. Buck International. Ward also started an after-school education program for kids in his home state of Georgia, where he attended Forest Park High School and went on to be a top scholar-athlete at the University of Georgia, earning All-SEC honors his senior year and finishing his college career as Georgia's second all-time receiver with 144 receptions. He currently lives in Atlanta with his wife and son.
Ward is represented by CSE Talent, which offers management and career assistance to its elite roster of over 200 clients including pro and collegiate coaches, baseball players, golfers, management, and news and sport media talent.

I do complain when it's a lie or when it's wrong.  But I have a strong temperament and it's a very good temperament and it's a very in control temperament or I wouldn't have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn't have built all of the things that I've been able to do in life.

I have a very strong temperament.  But I have a temperament that's totally under control.  And, you know, you - she - she mentions that I'll bring us into war.  She's the one that wanted to go into Iraq.  I mean she raised her hand.  She didn't know what the hell she was doing.  She raised her hand.

I do complain when it's a lie or when it's wrong.  But I have a strong temperament and it's a very good temperament and it's a very in control temperament or I wouldn't have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn't have built all of the things that I've been able to do in life.

CNN to deliver comprehensive EU referendum coverage 
Multiplatform news, debate and analysis of UK’s crucial vote
London, 2 June 2016: As the UK prepares to vote on whether to remain in the European Union, CNN will offer a mix of special ‘Brexit’ programming to audiences around the world, across TV and digital platforms.
Leading up to the poll on 23 June, CNN’s most experienced journalists will be getting to grips with the issues facing UK voters, and the implications of their decision for Europe and the world.  The network will take to the UK’s roads, host an interactive debate show, and provide the latest news and reaction as the results come in.
Gill Penlington, Director of News & Event Programming, EMEA at CNN International, said: “There is so much information, misinformation, conjecture and opinion around this vitally important story.  We’ll be talking to leading lights from all angles of the debate, debunking some of the myths, and getting into the minds of the voters whose decision will have implications across the world.”
Following the story will be CNN journalists including anchors Hala Gorani, Max Foster, and Nina dos Santos, as well as Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson.  They will be joined by CNNMoney Editor at Large, Richard Quest, and Chief International Correspondent, Christiane Amanpour.
Key programming and content:
On digital:
Full coverage of the referendum can be found at CNN.com/Brexit – including explainers, opinion, and the very latest news.
On CNN International:
From Monday 13 June, Richard Quest will be taking to the UK’s roads in a 1970s campervan for a week, to get the mood on the ground.  Visiting iconic locations he will talk to voters, as well as leading voices from business, politics, academia and culture.  In addition to updates through the day on CNN International and extensive coverage on CNNMoney, Quest Means Business will also be anchored live from the campervan throughout the week at 9pm GMT/10pm CET.
On Thursday 16 June at 7pm BST/8pm CET, Christiane Amanpour will host an interactive ‘Brexit reality check’.  Recorded at the McLaren Thought Leadership Centre, UK Decides: In or Out will feature a panel of high profile guests from both sides of the debate. Max Foster will be marshalling the studio audience, who will use high tech, interactive voting technology to have their say in real time on the key issues.
On Thursday 23 June, the day of the referendum itself, CNN will present coverage throughout the day.  Then, from the moment the polls close, at 10pm GMT/11pm CET, there will be rolling coverage of the results.  Anchored live from London, with correspondents stationed in key locations in the UK and Europe, CNN will bring up-to-the-minute developments through the night as the votes are counted.  The result will then be dissected the next day, with the ramifications for the UK, Europe and the world put under the microscope.

Popular CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man, hosted and produced by the Oscar®-nominated documentary filmmaker, launches its fourth season on Friday, June 3 at 10pm ET/PT with an inside look at professional gambling.
In his inimitable, inquisitive style, and with a sense of humor intact, Spurlock tells compelling stories from an insider’s perspective. In the new season Morgan tackles toxins, gambling, the space industry, disruptors, gaming, and crime scene investigations.
The multiple award-winning program averaged 546,000 total viewers and 244,000 Adults 25-54 for premiere episodes in season three (1/22-3/19/15) and posted its highest season performance ever among both Adults 25-54 and total viewers. It surpassed its season two average (airing on Sundays at 10pm) by 7% in Adults 25-54 (228,000) and 27% in total viewers (429,000).*
For embeddable clips from the new season, please click on the following link:  http://www.cnn.com/shows/inside-man
Below are descriptions of Morgan Spurlock Inside Man season four episodes (airdates subject to change):
DOUBLE OR NOTHING (airdate June 3 2016)
Spurlock enters the seductive world of professional gambling by spending a week in Las Vegas determined to beat the house. His exploration of this pastime, which often leads to serious addiction, takes him to casinos, bookies, the racetrack, Off Track Betting and just about any place that allows him to gamble.
ONE GIANT STEP FOR MORGAN (airdate June 10, 2016)
Spurlock “virtually” experiences life as an astronaut and investigates the future of the space industry. The host’s journey takes him to government and private facilities including NASA’s Johnson Space Center (Houston), the X-Prize Foundation (Culver City, CA.) and Virgin Atlantic’s Mojave Air & Space Port (CA.) to see how the rules of the game are changing and what it means for the human race.
THE TRUTH ABOUT TOXINS  (airdate June 17, 2016)
In a quest to rid his life of contaminants – which are prominent in food, cleaning products and even furniture, Spurlock gets professional help to “de-tox.” The host puts his body to the test, dabbling in chelation therapy, infrared saunas, electromagnetic-free sleep chambers, and various cleanses, to see if poisons can truly be flushed out of our bodies and surroundings in the modern world.
CSI: SPURLOCK (airdate June 24, 2016)
Separating fact from TV dramatizations, Spurlock embeds in a forensic science unit to understand first-hand how crime scene investigations are actually conducted.  From the first responders, to the collection of evidence (at CSI Academy in Alachua, FL and ATF training facility in Huntsville, AL) and its analysis in the lab, he gets a crash course in Crime 101 from beginning to end.
GAME CHANGERS (airdate July 1, 2016)
Screaming fans, sold-out arenas, and teenage superstars, Spurlock joins the ranks of professional video gamers in one of the fastest-growing sectors of the “sports” world. Committed to understanding this shockingly intense industry, he joins reigning League of Legends North American Champions, from Counter Logic Gaming, as they train to compete for a big cash prize at the World Championship in Paris.
SEEK AND DISRUPT! (airdate July 8, 2016)
Inspired by companies like Google, AirBnB, and Spotify, Spurlock attempts to fill a void in the marketplace and re-write the rules by becoming the next disruptor. An eye-opening trip to Silicon Valley provides industry advice from tech giants, and examines why companies like Uber often leave a trail of enemies in their wake and questions whether this golden era of tech will solve age-old problems.

Meet CNN Digital's New VP of Programming: Mitra Kalita 
Meet Mitra Kalita. She’ll be making a big move from the left coast to the right to head up programming for CNN Digital in the coming weeks. Mitra joins CNN from the Los Angeles Times, where she is serving as the publication’s managing editor. Before that, she was the executive editor of Quartz. She’s also worked for the Wall Street Journal, Mint and the Washington Post.
In her new role as VP of Programming, Mitra will lead CNN Digital’s efforts to creatively share its journalism and storytelling across an ever-exploding array of platforms. She will oversee the News & Alerting, Special Projects, and Mobile & Off-Platform teams. Mitra will be based in the Big Apple and report to Editor-in-Chief Meredith Artley.
Since no one really likes press releases, we decided to mix things up with a Q&A. Read on and join us in welcoming Mitra to CNN: @MitraKalita.
What’s your guilty pleasure?
Chips. Uber. Bright tights. The Office. The TV show, not the place.
VP of Programming sounds like a TV title.  What does that mean for Digital?   
The success of our journalism rests on two important factors: how good is the story and how good is the distribution. How adaptive are we to different devices and different platforms? How accessible, relatable, intimate, authoritative? Technically, I will oversee the homepage, alerts, projects and planning, mobile news and off-platform partnerships and initiatives. But really, I see this job as one that collaborates across departments, time zones and mediums to maximize the reach of our journalism.
If you weren’t a journalist, what would you be doing?
I can’t think of anything else I’d rather do.

“I’m incredibly grateful to HLN and CNN for welcoming me to their prestigious team,” said Ward. “Throughout my career, I’ve always envisioned myself as more than just a football player and this platform will allow me to express myself in different and unique ways. I’m excited to be able to share my journey and my stories with our audiences, both in the US and worldwide.”
“Hines is a true champion with such a winning personality,” said Bill Galvin, SVP, Sports Programming, CNN.  “His perspective on sports extends well beyond the football field – a fresh voice we’re excited to share with HLN and CNN audiences.”
Upon his retirement in 2012 from the NFL, where here he played for 14 years with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ward trained and completed the 2013 Ironman World Championships held annually in Hawaii. He began his television career as an analyst for NBC’s Sunday primetime NFL show, Football Night in America.
He founded and operates Helping Hands Foundations both in the U.S. and Korea, and is an active participant with numerous other charities including The Caring Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and Pearl S. Buck International. Ward also started an after-school education program for kids in his home state of Georgia, where he attended Forest Park High School and went on to be a top scholar-athlete at the University of Georgia, earning All-SEC honors his senior year and finishing his college career as Georgia's second all-time receiver with 144 receptions. He currently lives in Atlanta with his wife and son.
Ward is represented by CSE Talent, which offers management and career assistance to its elite roster of over 200 clients including pro and collegiate coaches, baseball players, golfers, management, and news and sport media talent.

CNN Story: 
Trump defends criticism of judge with Mexican heritage
 
Text Highlights
 
Trump on Clinton’s “thin skin” comment: “Well, first of all, I don't have thin skin, I have very, very strong, very thick skin.  And when somebody is right about me, I always - you know, if you do a report and it's not necessarily positive but you're right, I never complain. I do complain when it's a lie or when it's wrong.  But I have a strong temperament and it's a very good temperament and it's a very in control temperament or I wouldn't have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn't have built all of the things that I've been able to do in life. I mean, number one best-sellers, one of the best-selling books of all time, tremendous television success...[TAPPER]  I don't think anyone is... [TRUMP] I've been successful. Well, wait a minute, Jake. I've been successful in every business I've been in, if you think, real estate one of the most successful.  Uh, television, "The Apprentice," which is, forget it.  I mean NBC came to me.  They wanted to renew so badly you have no idea. [TAPPER]  But what does that have to do with temperament?...... [TRUMP] Oh, you can't have that success without good temperament. And I will say this.  I was thinking about the word temperament.  And we need a strong temperament in this country.  We have been led by weak people, weak ineffective people.  Countries have taken advantage of us, whether it's militarily or otherwise.  We have been taken advantage of by everybody.  We have people with weak temperaments. I have a very strong temperament.  But I have a temperament that's totally under control.  And, you know, you - she - she mentions that I'll bring us into war.  She's the one that wanted to go into Iraq.  I mean she raised her hand.  She didn't know what the hell she was doing.  She raised her hand. I said, I don't want to go into Iraq, Iraq is going to destabilize the Middle East and I was 100 percent right.”
 
 
Trump responds to criticism of judge with Mexican heritage “….[TRUMP] Do you know that these people went to every attorney general, practically, in the country that they could and do you know this case was turned down by almost every attorney general, from Texas to Florida to many of these states? [TAPPER]  Is it not, when Hillary Clinton says this is a racist attack and you reject that, if you are saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism? [TRUMP]  No, I don't think so at all. [TAPPER]  No? [TRUMP]  No.  He's proud of his heritage.  I - I respect him for that. [TAPPER]  But you're saying he can't do his job because of that. [TRUMP]  Look, he's proud of his heritage, OK.  I'm building a wall.  Now, I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. [TAPPER]  He's a legal citizen... [TRUMP]  You know why I'm going to do well with Hispanics? Because I'm going to bring back jobs and they're going to get jobs right now.  They're going to get jobs.  I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. But we're building a wall.  He's a Mexican.  We're building a wall between here and Mexico.  The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings, rulings that people can't even believe.  This case should have ended years ago on summary judgment.  The best lawyers - I have spoken to so many lawyers, they said this is not a case, this is a case that should have ended. [TAPPER]  I have... [TRUMP]  This judge is giving us unfair rulings. Now I say why? Well, I want to - I'm building a wall, OK, and it's a wall between Mexico, not another country...”

CNN to deliver comprehensive EU referendum coverage 
Multiplatform news, debate and analysis of UK’s crucial vote
London, 2 June 2016: As the UK prepares to vote on whether to remain in the European Union, CNN will offer a mix of special ‘Brexit’ programming to audiences around the world, across TV and digital platforms.
Leading up to the poll on 23 June, CNN’s most experienced journalists will be getting to grips with the issues facing UK voters, and the implications of their decision for Europe and the world.  The network will take to the UK’s roads, host an interactive debate show, and provide the latest news and reaction as the results come in.
Gill Penlington, Director of News & Event Programming, EMEA at CNN International, said: “There is so much information, misinformation, conjecture and opinion around this vitally important story.  We’ll be talking to leading lights from all angles of the debate, debunking some of the myths, and getting into the minds of the voters whose decision will have implications across the world.”
Following the story will be CNN journalists including anchors Hala Gorani, Max Foster, and Nina dos Santos, as well as Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson.  They will be joined by CNNMoney Editor at Large, Richard Quest, and Chief International Correspondent, Christiane Amanpour.
Key programming and content:
On digital:
Full coverage of the referendum can be found at CNN.com/Brexit – including explainers, opinion, and the very latest news.
On CNN International:
From Monday 13 June, Richard Quest will be taking to the UK’s roads in a 1970s campervan for a week, to get the mood on the ground.  Visiting iconic locations he will talk to voters, as well as leading voices from business, politics, academia and culture.  In addition to updates through the day on CNN International and extensive coverage on CNNMoney, Quest Means Business will also be anchored live from the campervan throughout the week at 9pm GMT/10pm CET.
On Thursday 16 June at 7pm BST/8pm CET, Christiane Amanpour will host an interactive ‘Brexit reality check’.  Recorded at the McLaren Thought Leadership Centre, UK Decides: In or Out will feature a panel of high profile guests from both sides of the debate. Max Foster will be marshalling the studio audience, who will use high tech, interactive voting technology to have their say in real time on the key issues.
On Thursday 23 June, the day of the referendum itself, CNN will present coverage throughout the day.  Then, from the moment the polls close, at 10pm GMT/11pm CET, there will be rolling coverage of the results.  Anchored live from London, with correspondents stationed in key locations in the UK and Europe, CNN will bring up-to-the-minute developments through the night as the votes are counted.  The result will then be dissected the next day, with the ramifications for the UK, Europe and the world put under the microscope.
ENDS

Update! Season Four Premiere of CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man Launches Friday, June 3, 10pm, ET/PT 
New Season Includes Spurlock’s Inside Look at Space, Gambling, Toxins, Disruptors, CSI and Gamers
Popular CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man, hosted and produced by the Oscar®-nominated documentary filmmaker, launches its fourth season on Friday, June 3 at 10pm ET/PT with an inside look at professional gambling.
In his inimitable, inquisitive style, and with a sense of humor intact, Spurlock tells compelling stories from an insider’s perspective. In the new season Morgan tackles toxins, gambling, the space industry, disruptors, gaming, and crime scene investigations.
The multiple award-winning program averaged 546,000 total viewers and 244,000 Adults 25-54 for premiere episodes in season three (1/22-3/19/15) and posted its highest season performance ever among both Adults 25-54 and total viewers. It surpassed its season two average (airing on Sundays at 10pm) by 7% in Adults 25-54 (228,000) and 27% in total viewers (429,000).*
For embeddable clips from the new season, please click on the following link:  http://www.cnn.com/shows/inside-man
Below are descriptions of Morgan Spurlock Inside Man season four episodes (airdates subject to change):
DOUBLE OR NOTHING (airdate June 3 2016)
Spurlock enters the seductive world of professional gambling by spending a week in Las Vegas determined to beat the house. His exploration of this pastime, which often leads to serious addiction, takes him to casinos, bookies, the racetrack, Off Track Betting and just about any place that allows him to gamble.
ONE GIANT STEP FOR MORGAN (airdate June 10, 2016)
Spurlock “virtually” experiences life as an astronaut and investigates the future of the space industry. The host’s journey takes him to government and private facilities including NASA’s Johnson Space Center (Houston), the X-Prize Foundation (Culver City, CA.) and Virgin Atlantic’s Mojave Air & Space Port (CA.) to see how the rules of the game are changing and what it means for the human race.
THE TRUTH ABOUT TOXINS  (airdate June 17, 2016)
In a quest to rid his life of contaminants – which are prominent in food, cleaning products and even furniture, Spurlock gets professional help to “de-tox.” The host puts his body to the test, dabbling in chelation therapy, infrared saunas, electromagnetic-free sleep chambers, and various cleanses, to see if poisons can truly be flushed out of our bodies and surroundings in the modern world.
CSI: SPURLOCK (airdate June 24, 2016)
Separating fact from TV dramatizations, Spurlock embeds in a forensic science unit to understand first-hand how crime scene investigations are actually conducted.  From the first responders, to the collection of evidence (at CSI Academy in Alachua, FL and ATF training facility in Huntsville, AL) and its analysis in the lab, he gets a crash course in Crime 101 from beginning to end.
GAME CHANGERS (airdate July 1, 2016)
Screaming fans, sold-out arenas, and teenage superstars, Spurlock joins the ranks of professional video gamers in one of the fastest-growing sectors of the “sports” world. Committed to understanding this shockingly intense industry, he joins reigning League of Legends North American Champions, from Counter Logic Gaming, as they train to compete for a big cash prize at the World Championship in Paris.
SEEK AND DISRUPT! (airdate July 8, 2016)
Inspired by companies like Google, AirBnB, and Spotify, Spurlock attempts to fill a void in the marketplace and re-write the rules by becoming the next disruptor. An eye-opening trip to Silicon Valley provides industry advice from tech giants, and examines why companies like Uber often leave a trail of enemies in their wake and questions whether this golden era of tech will solve age-old problems.

Meet CNN Digital's New VP of Programming: Mitra Kalita 
Meet Mitra Kalita. She’ll be making a big move from the left coast to the right to head up programming for CNN Digital in the coming weeks. Mitra joins CNN from the Los Angeles Times, where she is serving as the publication’s managing editor. Before that, she was the executive editor of Quartz. She’s also worked for the Wall Street Journal, Mint and the Washington Post.
In her new role as VP of Programming, Mitra will lead CNN Digital’s efforts to creatively share its journalism and storytelling across an ever-exploding array of platforms. She will oversee the News & Alerting, Special Projects, and Mobile & Off-Platform teams. Mitra will be based in the Big Apple and report to Editor-in-Chief Meredith Artley.
Since no one really likes press releases, we decided to mix things up with a Q&A. Read on and join us in welcoming Mitra to CNN: @MitraKalita.
What’s your guilty pleasure?
Chips. Uber. Bright tights. The Office. The TV show, not the place.
VP of Programming sounds like a TV title.  What does that mean for Digital?   
The success of our journalism rests on two important factors: how good is the story and how good is the distribution. How adaptive are we to different devices and different platforms? How accessible, relatable, intimate, authoritative? Technically, I will oversee the homepage, alerts, projects and planning, mobile news and off-platform partnerships and initiatives. But really, I see this job as one that collaborates across departments, time zones and mediums to maximize the reach of our journalism.
If you weren’t a journalist, what would you be doing?
I can’t think of anything else I’d rather do.

TWO-TIME SUPER BOWL CHAMP AND 'DANCING WITH THE STARS' MIRRORBALL WINNER HINES WARD JOINS HLN’S 'MORNING EXPRESS WITH ROBIN MEADE' AS SPORTS CONTRIBUTOR
Ward to Also Provide Sports Commentary and Analysis Across all CNN Platforms
Hines Ward, two-time Super Bowl champion and Dancing with the Stars Mirrorball trophy winner, joins HLN’s Morning Express with Robin Meade as sports contributor.  Based at the network’s headquarters in Atlanta, Ward will also provide analysis and commentary on major sporting events and breaking news across all CNN platforms, including CNN/U.S., CNN Digital, CNNMoney and CNN International.
Beginning July 1, the Super Bowl XL MVP, joins the popular HLN morning crew of host Robin Meade, meteorologist Bob Van Dillen and consumer business correspondent Jennifer Westhoven. Morning Express with Robin Meade is a ratings juggernaut for the network.  The wildly successful morning show is up double-digits year-to-date in both total viewers and persons 25-54.
“I’m incredibly grateful to HLN and CNN for welcoming me to their prestigious team,” said Ward. “Throughout my career, I’ve always envisioned myself as more than just a football player and this platform will allow me to express myself in different and unique ways. I’m excited to be able to share my journey and my stories with our audiences, both in the US and worldwide.”
“Hines is a true champion with such a winning personality,” said Bill Galvin, SVP, Sports Programming, CNN.  “His perspective on sports extends well beyond the football field – a fresh voice we’re excited to share with HLN and CNN audiences.”
Upon his retirement in 2012 from the NFL, where here he played for 14 years with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ward trained and completed the 2013 Ironman World Championships held annually in Hawaii. He began his television career as an analyst for NBC’s Sunday primetime NFL show, Football Night in America.
He founded and operates Helping Hands Foundations both in the U.S. and Korea, and is an active participant with numerous other charities including The Caring Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and Pearl S. Buck International. Ward also started an after-school education program for kids in his home state of Georgia, where he attended Forest Park High School and went on to be a top scholar-athlete at the University of Georgia, earning All-SEC honors his senior year and finishing his college career as Georgia's second all-time receiver with 144 receptions. He currently lives in Atlanta with his wife and son.
Ward is represented by CSE Talent, which offers management and career assistance to its elite roster of over 200 clients including pro and collegiate coaches, baseball players, golfers, management, and news and sport media talent.

VIDEO:
Donald Trump hits back at Clinton's 'thin skin' comment
Donald Trump rails against judge's 'Mexican heritage'
 
CNN Story: 
Trump defends criticism of judge with Mexican heritage
 
Text Highlights
 
Trump on Clinton’s “thin skin” comment: “Well, first of all, I don't have thin skin, I have very, very strong, very thick skin.  And when somebody is right about me, I always - you know, if you do a report and it's not necessarily positive but you're right, I never complain. I do complain when it's a lie or when it's wrong.  But I have a strong temperament and it's a very good temperament and it's a very in control temperament or I wouldn't have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn't have built all of the things that I've been able to do in life. I mean, number one best-sellers, one of the best-selling books of all time, tremendous television success...[TAPPER]  I don't think anyone is... [TRUMP] I've been successful. Well, wait a minute, Jake. I've been successful in every business I've been in, if you think, real estate one of the most successful.  Uh, television, "The Apprentice," which is, forget it.  I mean NBC came to me.  They wanted to renew so badly you have no idea. [TAPPER]  But what does that have to do with temperament?...... [TRUMP] Oh, you can't have that success without good temperament. And I will say this.  I was thinking about the word temperament.  And we need a strong temperament in this country.  We have been led by weak people, weak ineffective people.  Countries have taken advantage of us, whether it's militarily or otherwise.  We have been taken advantage of by everybody.  We have people with weak temperaments. I have a very strong temperament.  But I have a temperament that's totally under control.  And, you know, you - she - she mentions that I'll bring us into war.  She's the one that wanted to go into Iraq.  I mean she raised her hand.  She didn't know what the hell she was doing.  She raised her hand. I said, I don't want to go into Iraq, Iraq is going to destabilize the Middle East and I was 100 percent right.”
 
 
Trump responds to criticism of judge with Mexican heritage “….[TRUMP] Do you know that these people went to every attorney general, practically, in the country that they could and do you know this case was turned down by almost every attorney general, from Texas to Florida to many of these states? [TAPPER]  Is it not, when Hillary Clinton says this is a racist attack and you reject that, if you are saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism? [TRUMP]  No, I don't think so at all. [TAPPER]  No? [TRUMP]  No.  He's proud of his heritage.  I - I respect him for that. [TAPPER]  But you're saying he can't do his job because of that. [TRUMP]  Look, he's proud of his heritage, OK.  I'm building a wall.  Now, I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. [TAPPER]  He's a legal citizen... [TRUMP]  You know why I'm going to do well with Hispanics? Because I'm going to bring back jobs and they're going to get jobs right now.  They're going to get jobs.  I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. But we're building a wall.  He's a Mexican.  We're building a wall between here and Mexico.  The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings, rulings that people can't even believe.  This case should have ended years ago on summary judgment.  The best lawyers - I have spoken to so many lawyers, they said this is not a case, this is a case that should have ended. [TAPPER]  I have... [TRUMP]  This judge is giving us unfair rulings. Now I say why? Well, I want to - I'm building a wall, OK, and it's a wall between Mexico, not another country...”

Trump defends criticism of judge with Mexican heritage
 
Text Highlights
 
Trump on Clinton’s “thin skin” comment: Well, first of all, I don't have thin skin, I have very, very strong, very thick skin.  And when somebody is right about me, I always - you know, if you do a report and it's not necessarily positive but you're right, I never complain. I do complain when it's a lie or when it's wrong.  But I have a strong temperament and it's a very good temperament and it's a very in control temperament or I wouldn't have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn't have built all of the things that I've been able to do in life. I mean, number one best-sellers, one of the best-selling books of all time, tremendous television success...[TAPPER]  I don't think anyone is... [TRUMP] I've been successful. Well, wait a minute, Jake. I've been successful in every business I've been in, if you think, real estate one of the most successful.  Uh, television, "The Apprentice," which is, forget it.  I mean NBC came to me.  They wanted to renew so badly you have no idea. [TAPPER]  But what does that have to do with temperament?...... [TRUMP] Oh, you can't have that success without good temperament. And I will say this.  I was thinking about the word temperament.  And we need a strong temperament in this country.  We have been led by weak people, weak ineffective people.  Countries have taken advantage of us, whether it's militarily or otherwise.  We have been taken advantage of by everybody.  We have people with weak temperaments. I have a very strong temperament.  But I have a temperament that's totally under control.  And, you know, you - she - she mentions that I'll bring us into war.  She's the one that wanted to go into Iraq.  I mean she raised her hand.  She didn't know what the hell she was doing.  She raised her hand. I said, I don't want to go into Iraq, Iraq is going to destabilize the Middle East and I was 100 percent right.

CNN to deliver comprehensive EU referendum coverage 
Multiplatform news, debate and analysis of UK’s crucial vote
London, 2 June 2016: As the UK prepares to vote on whether to remain in the European Union, CNN will offer a mix of special ‘Brexit’ programming to audiences around the world, across TV and digital platforms.
Leading up to the poll on 23 June, CNN’s most experienced journalists will be getting to grips with the issues facing UK voters, and the implications of their decision for Europe and the world.  The network will take to the UK’s roads, host an interactive debate show, and provide the latest news and reaction as the results come in.
Gill Penlington, Director of News & Event Programming, EMEA at CNN International, said: “There is so much information, misinformation, conjecture and opinion around this vitally important story.  We’ll be talking to leading lights from all angles of the debate, debunking some of the myths, and getting into the minds of the voters whose decision will have implications across the world.”
Following the story will be CNN journalists including anchors Hala Gorani, Max Foster, and Nina dos Santos, as well as Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson.  They will be joined by CNNMoney Editor at Large, Richard Quest, and Chief International Correspondent, Christiane Amanpour.
Key programming and content:
On digital:
Full coverage of the referendum can be found at CNN.com/Brexit – including explainers, opinion, and the very latest news.
On CNN International:
From Monday 13 June, Richard Quest will be taking to the UK’s roads in a 1970s campervan for a week, to get the mood on the ground.  Visiting iconic locations he will talk to voters, as well as leading voices from business, politics, academia and culture.  In addition to updates through the day on CNN International and extensive coverage on CNNMoney, Quest Means Business will also be anchored live from the campervan throughout the week at 9pm GMT/10pm CET.
On Thursday 16 June at 7pm BST/8pm CET, Christiane Amanpour will host an interactive ‘Brexit reality check’.  Recorded at the McLaren Thought Leadership Centre, UK Decides: In or Out will feature a panel of high profile guests from both sides of the debate. Max Foster will be marshalling the studio audience, who will use high tech, interactive voting technology to have their say in real time on the key issues.
On Thursday 23 June, the day of the referendum itself, CNN will present coverage throughout the day.  Then, from the moment the polls close, at 10pm GMT/11pm CET, there will be rolling coverage of the results.  Anchored live from London, with correspondents stationed in key locations in the UK and Europe, CNN will bring up-to-the-minute developments through the night as the votes are counted.  The result will then be dissected the next day, with the ramifications for the UK, Europe and the world put under the microscope.

Popular CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man, hosted and produced by the Oscar®-nominated documentary filmmaker, launches its fourth season on Friday, June 3 at 10pm ET/PT with an inside look at professional gambling.
In his inimitable, inquisitive style, and with a sense of humor intact, Spurlock tells compelling stories from an insider’s perspective. In the new season Morgan tackles toxins, gambling, the space industry, disruptors, gaming, and crime scene investigations.
The multiple award-winning program averaged 546,000 total viewers and 244,000 Adults 25-54 for premiere episodes in season three (1/22-3/19/15) and posted its highest season performance ever among both Adults 25-54 and total viewers. It surpassed its season two average (airing on Sundays at 10pm) by 7% in Adults 25-54 (228,000) and 27% in total viewers (429,000).*
For embeddable clips from the new season, please click on the following link:  http://www.cnn.com/shows/inside-man
Below are descriptions of Morgan Spurlock Inside Man season four episodes (airdates subject to change):
DOUBLE OR NOTHING (airdate June 3 2016)
Spurlock enters the seductive world of professional gambling by spending a week in Las Vegas determined to beat the house. His exploration of this pastime, which often leads to serious addiction, takes him to casinos, bookies, the racetrack, Off Track Betting and just about any place that allows him to gamble.
ONE GIANT STEP FOR MORGAN (airdate June 10, 2016)
Spurlock “virtually” experiences life as an astronaut and investigates the future of the space industry. The host’s journey takes him to government and private facilities including NASA’s Johnson Space Center (Houston), the X-Prize Foundation (Culver City, CA.) and Virgin Atlantic’s Mojave Air & Space Port (CA.) to see how the rules of the game are changing and what it means for the human race.
THE TRUTH ABOUT TOXINS  (airdate June 17, 2016)
In a quest to rid his life of contaminants – which are prominent in food, cleaning products and even furniture, Spurlock gets professional help to “de-tox.” The host puts his body to the test, dabbling in chelation therapy, infrared saunas, electromagnetic-free sleep chambers, and various cleanses, to see if poisons can truly be flushed out of our bodies and surroundings in the modern world.
CSI: SPURLOCK (airdate June 24, 2016)
Separating fact from TV dramatizations, Spurlock embeds in a forensic science unit to understand first-hand how crime scene investigations are actually conducted.  From the first responders, to the collection of evidence (at CSI Academy in Alachua, FL and ATF training facility in Huntsville, AL) and its analysis in the lab, he gets a crash course in Crime 101 from beginning to end.
GAME CHANGERS (airdate July 1, 2016)
Screaming fans, sold-out arenas, and teenage superstars, Spurlock joins the ranks of professional video gamers in one of the fastest-growing sectors of the “sports” world. Committed to understanding this shockingly intense industry, he joins reigning League of Legends North American Champions, from Counter Logic Gaming, as they train to compete for a big cash prize at the World Championship in Paris.
SEEK AND DISRUPT! (airdate July 8, 2016)
Inspired by companies like Google, AirBnB, and Spotify, Spurlock attempts to fill a void in the marketplace and re-write the rules by becoming the next disruptor. An eye-opening trip to Silicon Valley provides industry advice from tech giants, and examines why companies like Uber often leave a trail of enemies in their wake and questions whether this golden era of tech will solve age-old problems.

Meet CNN Digital's New VP of Programming: Mitra Kalita 
Meet Mitra Kalita. She’ll be making a big move from the left coast to the right to head up programming for CNN Digital in the coming weeks. Mitra joins CNN from the Los Angeles Times, where she is serving as the publication’s managing editor. Before that, she was the executive editor of Quartz. She’s also worked for the Wall Street Journal, Mint and the Washington Post.
In her new role as VP of Programming, Mitra will lead CNN Digital’s efforts to creatively share its journalism and storytelling across an ever-exploding array of platforms. She will oversee the News & Alerting, Special Projects, and Mobile & Off-Platform teams. Mitra will be based in the Big Apple and report to Editor-in-Chief Meredith Artley.
Since no one really likes press releases, we decided to mix things up with a Q&A. Read on and join us in welcoming Mitra to CNN: @MitraKalita.
What’s your guilty pleasure?
Chips. Uber. Bright tights. The Office. The TV show, not the place.
VP of Programming sounds like a TV title.  What does that mean for Digital?   
The success of our journalism rests on two important factors: how good is the story and how good is the distribution. How adaptive are we to different devices and different platforms? How accessible, relatable, intimate, authoritative? Technically, I will oversee the homepage, alerts, projects and planning, mobile news and off-platform partnerships and initiatives. But really, I see this job as one that collaborates across departments, time zones and mediums to maximize the reach of our journalism.
If you weren’t a journalist, what would you be doing?
I can’t think of anything else I’d rather do.

Beginning July 1, the Super Bowl XL MVP, joins the popular HLN morning crew of host Robin Meade, meteorologist Bob Van Dillen and consumer business correspondent Jennifer Westhoven. Morning Express with Robin Meade is a ratings juggernaut for the network.  The wildly successful morning show is up double-digits year-to-date in both total viewers and persons 25-54.
“I’m incredibly grateful to HLN and CNN for welcoming me to their prestigious team,” said Ward. “Throughout my career, I’ve always envisioned myself as more than just a football player and this platform will allow me to express myself in different and unique ways. I’m excited to be able to share my journey and my stories with our audiences, both in the US and worldwide.”
“Hines is a true champion with such a winning personality,” said Bill Galvin, SVP, Sports Programming, CNN.  “His perspective on sports extends well beyond the football field – a fresh voice we’re excited to share with HLN and CNN audiences.”
Upon his retirement in 2012 from the NFL, where here he played for 14 years with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ward trained and completed the 2013 Ironman World Championships held annually in Hawaii. He began his television career as an analyst for NBC’s Sunday primetime NFL show, Football Night in America.
He founded and operates Helping Hands Foundations both in the U.S. and Korea, and is an active participant with numerous other charities including The Caring Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and Pearl S. Buck International. Ward also started an after-school education program for kids in his home state of Georgia, where he attended Forest Park High School and went on to be a top scholar-athlete at the University of Georgia, earning All-SEC honors his senior year and finishing his college career as Georgia's second all-time receiver with 144 receptions. He currently lives in Atlanta with his wife and son.
Ward is represented by CSE Talent, which offers management and career assistance to its elite roster of over 200 clients including pro and collegiate coaches, baseball players, golfers, management, and news and sport media talent.

Donald Trump hits back at Clinton's 'thin skin' comment

CNN Story: 
Trump defends criticism of judge with Mexican heritage
 
Text Highlights
 
Trump on Clinton’s “thin skin” comment: “Well, first of all, I don't have thin skin, I have very, very strong, very thick skin.  And when somebody is right about me, I always - you know, if you do a report and it's not necessarily positive but you're right, I never complain. I do complain when it's a lie or when it's wrong.  But I have a strong temperament and it's a very good temperament and it's a very in control temperament or I wouldn't have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn't have built all of the things that I've been able to do in life. I mean, number one best-sellers, one of the best-selling books of all time, tremendous television success...[TAPPER]  I don't think anyone is... [TRUMP] I've been successful. Well, wait a minute, Jake. I've been successful in every business I've been in, if you think, real estate one of the most successful.  Uh, television, "The Apprentice," which is, forget it.  I mean NBC came to me.  They wanted to renew so badly you have no idea. [TAPPER]  But what does that have to do with temperament?...... [TRUMP] Oh, you can't have that success without good temperament. And I will say this.  I was thinking about the word temperament.  And we need a strong temperament in this country.  We have been led by weak people, weak ineffective people.  Countries have taken advantage of us, whether it's militarily or otherwise.  We have been taken advantage of by everybody.  We have people with weak temperaments. I have a very strong temperament.  But I have a temperament that's totally under control.  And, you know, you - she - she mentions that I'll bring us into war.  She's the one that wanted to go into Iraq.  I mean she raised her hand.  She didn't know what the hell she was doing.  She raised her hand. I said, I don't want to go into Iraq, Iraq is going to destabilize the Middle East and I was 100 percent right.”
 
 
Trump responds to criticism of judge with Mexican heritage “….[TRUMP] Do you know that these people went to every attorney general, practically, in the country that they could and do you know this case was turned down by almost every attorney general, from Texas to Florida to many of these states? [TAPPER]  Is it not, when Hillary Clinton says this is a racist attack and you reject that, if you are saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism? [TRUMP]  No, I don't think so at all. [TAPPER]  No? [TRUMP]  No.  He's proud of his heritage.  I - I respect him for that. [TAPPER]  But you're saying he can't do his job because of that. [TRUMP]  Look, he's proud of his heritage, OK.  I'm building a wall.  Now, I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. [TAPPER]  He's a legal citizen... [TRUMP]  You know why I'm going to do well with Hispanics? Because I'm going to bring back jobs and they're going to get jobs right now.  They're going to get jobs.  I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. But we're building a wall.  He's a Mexican.  We're building a wall between here and Mexico.  The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings, rulings that people can't even believe.  This case should have ended years ago on summary judgment.  The best lawyers - I have spoken to so many lawyers, they said this is not a case, this is a case that should have ended. [TAPPER]  I have... [TRUMP]  This judge is giving us unfair rulings. Now I say why? Well, I want to - I'm building a wall, OK, and it's a wall between Mexico, not another country...”

CNN to deliver comprehensive EU referendum coverage 
Multiplatform news, debate and analysis of UK’s crucial vote
London, 2 June 2016: As the UK prepares to vote on whether to remain in the European Union, CNN will offer a mix of special ‘Brexit’ programming to audiences around the world, across TV and digital platforms.
Leading up to the poll on 23 June, CNN’s most experienced journalists will be getting to grips with the issues facing UK voters, and the implications of their decision for Europe and the world.  The network will take to the UK’s roads, host an interactive debate show, and provide the latest news and reaction as the results come in.
Gill Penlington, Director of News & Event Programming, EMEA at CNN International, said: “There is so much information, misinformation, conjecture and opinion around this vitally important story.  We’ll be talking to leading lights from all angles of the debate, debunking some of the myths, and getting into the minds of the voters whose decision will have implications across the world.”
Following the story will be CNN journalists including anchors Hala Gorani, Max Foster, and Nina dos Santos, as well as Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson.  They will be joined by CNNMoney Editor at Large, Richard Quest, and Chief International Correspondent, Christiane Amanpour.
Key programming and content:
On digital:
Full coverage of the referendum can be found at CNN.com/Brexit – including explainers, opinion, and the very latest news.
On CNN International:
From Monday 13 June, Richard Quest will be taking to the UK’s roads in a 1970s campervan for a week, to get the mood on the ground.  Visiting iconic locations he will talk to voters, as well as leading voices from business, politics, academia and culture.  In addition to updates through the day on CNN International and extensive coverage on CNNMoney, Quest Means Business will also be anchored live from the campervan throughout the week at 9pm GMT/10pm CET.
On Thursday 16 June at 7pm BST/8pm CET, Christiane Amanpour will host an interactive ‘Brexit reality check’.  Recorded at the McLaren Thought Leadership Centre, UK Decides: In or Out will feature a panel of high profile guests from both sides of the debate. Max Foster will be marshalling the studio audience, who will use high tech, interactive voting technology to have their say in real time on the key issues.
On Thursday 23 June, the day of the referendum itself, CNN will present coverage throughout the day.  Then, from the moment the polls close, at 10pm GMT/11pm CET, there will be rolling coverage of the results.  Anchored live from London, with correspondents stationed in key locations in the UK and Europe, CNN will bring up-to-the-minute developments through the night as the votes are counted.  The result will then be dissected the next day, with the ramifications for the UK, Europe and the world put under the microscope.
ENDS

Update! Season Four Premiere of CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man Launches Friday, June 3, 10pm, ET/PT 
New Season Includes Spurlock’s Inside Look at Space, Gambling, Toxins, Disruptors, CSI and Gamers
Popular CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man, hosted and produced by the Oscar®-nominated documentary filmmaker, launches its fourth season on Friday, June 3 at 10pm ET/PT with an inside look at professional gambling.
In his inimitable, inquisitive style, and with a sense of humor intact, Spurlock tells compelling stories from an insider’s perspective. In the new season Morgan tackles toxins, gambling, the space industry, disruptors, gaming, and crime scene investigations.
The multiple award-winning program averaged 546,000 total viewers and 244,000 Adults 25-54 for premiere episodes in season three (1/22-3/19/15) and posted its highest season performance ever among both Adults 25-54 and total viewers. It surpassed its season two average (airing on Sundays at 10pm) by 7% in Adults 25-54 (228,000) and 27% in total viewers (429,000).*
For embeddable clips from the new season, please click on the following link:  http://www.cnn.com/shows/inside-man
Below are descriptions of Morgan Spurlock Inside Man season four episodes (airdates subject to change):
DOUBLE OR NOTHING (airdate June 3 2016)
Spurlock enters the seductive world of professional gambling by spending a week in Las Vegas determined to beat the house. His exploration of this pastime, which often leads to serious addiction, takes him to casinos, bookies, the racetrack, Off Track Betting and just about any place that allows him to gamble.
ONE GIANT STEP FOR MORGAN (airdate June 10, 2016)
Spurlock “virtually” experiences life as an astronaut and investigates the future of the space industry. The host’s journey takes him to government and private facilities including NASA’s Johnson Space Center (Houston), the X-Prize Foundation (Culver City, CA.) and Virgin Atlantic’s Mojave Air & Space Port (CA.) to see how the rules of the game are changing and what it means for the human race.
THE TRUTH ABOUT TOXINS  (airdate June 17, 2016)
In a quest to rid his life of contaminants – which are prominent in food, cleaning products and even furniture, Spurlock gets professional help to “de-tox.” The host puts his body to the test, dabbling in chelation therapy, infrared saunas, electromagnetic-free sleep chambers, and various cleanses, to see if poisons can truly be flushed out of our bodies and surroundings in the modern world.
CSI: SPURLOCK (airdate June 24, 2016)
Separating fact from TV dramatizations, Spurlock embeds in a forensic science unit to understand first-hand how crime scene investigations are actually conducted.  From the first responders, to the collection of evidence (at CSI Academy in Alachua, FL and ATF training facility in Huntsville, AL) and its analysis in the lab, he gets a crash course in Crime 101 from beginning to end.
GAME CHANGERS (airdate July 1, 2016)
Screaming fans, sold-out arenas, and teenage superstars, Spurlock joins the ranks of professional video gamers in one of the fastest-growing sectors of the “sports” world. Committed to understanding this shockingly intense industry, he joins reigning League of Legends North American Champions, from Counter Logic Gaming, as they train to compete for a big cash prize at the World Championship in Paris.
SEEK AND DISRUPT! (airdate July 8, 2016)
Inspired by companies like Google, AirBnB, and Spotify, Spurlock attempts to fill a void in the marketplace and re-write the rules by becoming the next disruptor. An eye-opening trip to Silicon Valley provides industry advice from tech giants, and examines why companies like Uber often leave a trail of enemies in their wake and questions whether this golden era of tech will solve age-old problems.

Meet CNN Digital's New VP of Programming: Mitra Kalita 
Meet Mitra Kalita. She’ll be making a big move from the left coast to the right to head up programming for CNN Digital in the coming weeks. Mitra joins CNN from the Los Angeles Times, where she is serving as the publication’s managing editor. Before that, she was the executive editor of Quartz. She’s also worked for the Wall Street Journal, Mint and the Washington Post.
In her new role as VP of Programming, Mitra will lead CNN Digital’s efforts to creatively share its journalism and storytelling across an ever-exploding array of platforms. She will oversee the News & Alerting, Special Projects, and Mobile & Off-Platform teams. Mitra will be based in the Big Apple and report to Editor-in-Chief Meredith Artley.
Since no one really likes press releases, we decided to mix things up with a Q&A. Read on and join us in welcoming Mitra to CNN: @MitraKalita.
What’s your guilty pleasure?
Chips. Uber. Bright tights. The Office. The TV show, not the place.
VP of Programming sounds like a TV title.  What does that mean for Digital?   
The success of our journalism rests on two important factors: how good is the story and how good is the distribution. How adaptive are we to different devices and different platforms? How accessible, relatable, intimate, authoritative? Technically, I will oversee the homepage, alerts, projects and planning, mobile news and off-platform partnerships and initiatives. But really, I see this job as one that collaborates across departments, time zones and mediums to maximize the reach of our journalism.
If you weren’t a journalist, what would you be doing?
I can’t think of anything else I’d rather do.

I’m excited to be able to share my journey and my stories with our audiences, both in the US and worldwide.”
“Hines is a true champion with such a winning personality,” said Bill Galvin, SVP, Sports Programming, CNN.  “His perspective on sports extends well beyond the football field – a fresh voice we’re excited to share with HLN and CNN audiences.”
Upon his retirement in 2012 from the NFL, where here he played for 14 years with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ward trained and completed the 2013 Ironman World Championships held annually in Hawaii. He began his television career as an analyst for NBC’s Sunday primetime NFL show, Football Night in America.
He founded and operates Helping Hands Foundations both in the U.S. and Korea, and is an active participant with numerous other charities including The Caring Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and Pearl S. Buck International. Ward also started an after-school education program for kids in his home state of Georgia, where he attended Forest Park High School and went on to be a top scholar-athlete at the University of Georgia, earning All-SEC honors his senior year and finishing his college career as Georgia's second all-time receiver with 144 receptions. He currently lives in Atlanta with his wife and son.
Ward is represented by CSE Talent, which offers management and career assistance to its elite roster of over 200 clients including pro and collegiate coaches, baseball players, golfers, management, and news and sport media talent.

Please see below for a full rushed transcript.

VIDEO:
Donald Trump hits back at Clinton's 'thin skin' comment
Donald Trump rails against judge's 'Mexican heritage'
 
CNN Story: 
Trump defends criticism of judge with Mexican heritage
 
Text Highlights
 
Trump on Clinton’s “thin skin” comment: “Well, first of all, I don't have thin skin, I have very, very strong, very thick skin.  And when somebody is right about me, I always - you know, if you do a report and it's not necessarily positive but you're right, I never complain. I do complain when it's a lie or when it's wrong.  But I have a strong temperament and it's a very good temperament and it's a very in control temperament or I wouldn't have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn't have built all of the things that I've been able to do in life. I mean, number one best-sellers, one of the best-selling books of all time, tremendous television success...[TAPPER]  I don't think anyone is... [TRUMP] I've been successful. Well, wait a minute, Jake. I've been successful in every business I've been in, if you think, real estate one of the most successful.  Uh, television, "The Apprentice," which is, forget it.  I mean NBC came to me.  They wanted to renew so badly you have no idea. [TAPPER]  But what does that have to do with temperament?...... [TRUMP] Oh, you can't have that success without good temperament. And I will say this.  I was thinking about the word temperament.  And we need a strong temperament in this country.  We have been led by weak people, weak ineffective people.  Countries have taken advantage of us, whether it's militarily or otherwise.  We have been taken advantage of by everybody.  We have people with weak temperaments. I have a very strong temperament.  But I have a temperament that's totally under control.  And, you know, you - she - she mentions that I'll bring us into war.  She's the one that wanted to go into Iraq.  I mean she raised her hand.  She didn't know what the hell she was doing.  She raised her hand. I said, I don't want to go into Iraq, Iraq is going to destabilize the Middle East and I was 100 percent right.”
 
 
Trump responds to criticism of judge with Mexican heritage “….[TRUMP] Do you know that these people went to every attorney general, practically, in the country that they could and do you know this case was turned down by almost every attorney general, from Texas to Florida to many of these states? [TAPPER]  Is it not, when Hillary Clinton says this is a racist attack and you reject that, if you are saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism? [TRUMP]  No, I don't think so at all. [TAPPER]  No? [TRUMP]  No.  He's proud of his heritage.  I - I respect him for that. [TAPPER]  But you're saying he can't do his job because of that. [TRUMP]  Look, he's proud of his heritage, OK.  I'm building a wall.  Now, I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. [TAPPER]  He's a legal citizen... [TRUMP]  You know why I'm going to do well with Hispanics? Because I'm going to bring back jobs and they're going to get jobs right now.  They're going to get jobs.  I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. But we're building a wall.  He's a Mexican.  We're building a wall between here and Mexico.  The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings, rulings that people can't even believe.  This case should have ended years ago on summary judgment.  The best lawyers - I have spoken to so many lawyers, they said this is not a case, this is a case that should have ended. [TAPPER]  I have... [TRUMP]  This judge is giving us unfair rulings. Now I say why? Well, I want to - I'm building a wall, OK, and it's a wall between Mexico, not another country...”

CNN Story: 
Trump defends criticism of judge with Mexican heritage
 
Text Highlights
 
Trump on Clinton’s “thin skin” comment: Well, first of all, I don't have thin skin, I have very, very strong, very thick skin.  And when somebody is right about me, I always - you know, if you do a report and it's not necessarily positive but you're right, I never complain. I do complain when it's a lie or when it's wrong.  But I have a strong temperament and it's a very good temperament and it's a very in control temperament or I wouldn't have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn't have built all of the things that I've been able to do in life. I mean, number one best-sellers, one of the best-selling books of all time, tremendous television success...[TAPPER]  I don't think anyone is... [TRUMP] I've been successful. Well, wait a minute, Jake. I've been successful in every business I've been in, if you think, real estate one of the most successful.  Uh, television, "The Apprentice," which is, forget it.  I mean NBC came to me.  They wanted to renew so badly you have no idea. [TAPPER]  But what does that have to do with temperament?...... [TRUMP] Oh, you can't have that success without good temperament. And I will say this.  I was thinking about the word temperament.  And we need a strong temperament in this country.  We have been led by weak people, weak ineffective people.  Countries have taken advantage of us, whether it's militarily or otherwise.  We have been taken advantage of by everybody.  We have people with weak temperaments. I have a very strong temperament.  But I have a temperament that's totally under control.  And, you know, you - she - she mentions that I'll bring us into war.  She's the one that wanted to go into Iraq.  I mean she raised her hand.  She didn't know what the hell she was doing.  She raised her hand. I said, I don't want to go into Iraq, Iraq is going to destabilize the Middle East and I was 100 percent right.
 
 
Trump responds to criticism of judge with Mexican heritage “….[TRUMP] Do you know that these people went to every attorney general, practically, in the country that they could and do you know this case was turned down by almost every attorney general, from Texas to Florida to many of these states? [TAPPER]  Is it not, when Hillary Clinton says this is a racist attack and you reject that, if you are saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism? [TRUMP]  No, I don't think so at all. [TAPPER]  No? [TRUMP]  No.  He's proud of his heritage.  I - I respect him for that. [TAPPER]  But you're saying he can't do his job because of that. [TRUMP]  Look, he's proud of his heritage, OK.  I'm building a wall.  Now, I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. [TAPPER]  He's a legal citizen... [TRUMP]  You know why I'm going to do well with Hispanics? Because I'm going to bring back jobs and they're going to get jobs right now.  They're going to get jobs.  I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. But we're building a wall.  He's a Mexican.  We're building a wall between here and Mexico.  The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings, rulings that people can't even believe.  This case should have ended years ago on summary judgment.  The best lawyers - I have spoken to so many lawyers, they said this is not a case, this is a case that should have ended. [TAPPER]  I have... [TRUMP]  This judge is giving us unfair rulings. Now I say why? Well, I want to - I'm building a wall, OK, and it's a wall between Mexico, not another country...”

CNN to deliver comprehensive EU referendum coverage 
Multiplatform news, debate and analysis of UK’s crucial vote
London, 2 June 2016: As the UK prepares to vote on whether to remain in the European Union, CNN will offer a mix of special ‘Brexit’ programming to audiences around the world, across TV and digital platforms.
Leading up to the poll on 23 June, CNN’s most experienced journalists will be getting to grips with the issues facing UK voters, and the implications of their decision for Europe and the world.  The network will take to the UK’s roads, host an interactive debate show, and provide the latest news and reaction as the results come in.
Gill Penlington, Director of News & Event Programming, EMEA at CNN International, said: “There is so much information, misinformation, conjecture and opinion around this vitally important story.  We’ll be talking to leading lights from all angles of the debate, debunking some of the myths, and getting into the minds of the voters whose decision will have implications across the world.”
Following the story will be CNN journalists including anchors Hala Gorani, Max Foster, and Nina dos Santos, as well as Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson.  They will be joined by CNNMoney Editor at Large, Richard Quest, and Chief International Correspondent, Christiane Amanpour.
Key programming and content:
On digital:
Full coverage of the referendum can be found at CNN.com/Brexit – including explainers, opinion, and the very latest news.
On CNN International:
From Monday 13 June, Richard Quest will be taking to the UK’s roads in a 1970s campervan for a week, to get the mood on the ground.  Visiting iconic locations he will talk to voters, as well as leading voices from business, politics, academia and culture.  In addition to updates through the day on CNN International and extensive coverage on CNNMoney, Quest Means Business will also be anchored live from the campervan throughout the week at 9pm GMT/10pm CET.
On Thursday 16 June at 7pm BST/8pm CET, Christiane Amanpour will host an interactive ‘Brexit reality check’.  Recorded at the McLaren Thought Leadership Centre, UK Decides: In or Out will feature a panel of high profile guests from both sides of the debate. Max Foster will be marshalling the studio audience, who will use high tech, interactive voting technology to have their say in real time on the key issues.
On Thursday 23 June, the day of the referendum itself, CNN will present coverage throughout the day.  Then, from the moment the polls close, at 10pm GMT/11pm CET, there will be rolling coverage of the results.  Anchored live from London, with correspondents stationed in key locations in the UK and Europe, CNN will bring up-to-the-minute developments through the night as the votes are counted.  The result will then be dissected the next day, with the ramifications for the UK, Europe and the world put under the microscope.

Popular CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man, hosted and produced by the Oscar®-nominated documentary filmmaker, launches its fourth season on Friday, June 3 at 10pm ET/PT with an inside look at professional gambling.
In his inimitable, inquisitive style, and with a sense of humor intact, Spurlock tells compelling stories from an insider’s perspective. In the new season Morgan tackles toxins, gambling, the space industry, disruptors, gaming, and crime scene investigations.
The multiple award-winning program averaged 546,000 total viewers and 244,000 Adults 25-54 for premiere episodes in season three (1/22-3/19/15) and posted its highest season performance ever among both Adults 25-54 and total viewers. It surpassed its season two average (airing on Sundays at 10pm) by 7% in Adults 25-54 (228,000) and 27% in total viewers (429,000).*
For embeddable clips from the new season, please click on the following link:  http://www.cnn.com/shows/inside-man
Below are descriptions of Morgan Spurlock Inside Man season four episodes (airdates subject to change):
DOUBLE OR NOTHING (airdate June 3 2016)
Spurlock enters the seductive world of professional gambling by spending a week in Las Vegas determined to beat the house. His exploration of this pastime, which often leads to serious addiction, takes him to casinos, bookies, the racetrack, Off Track Betting and just about any place that allows him to gamble.
ONE GIANT STEP FOR MORGAN (airdate June 10, 2016)
Spurlock “virtually” experiences life as an astronaut and investigates the future of the space industry. The host’s journey takes him to government and private facilities including NASA’s Johnson Space Center (Houston), the X-Prize Foundation (Culver City, CA.) and Virgin Atlantic’s Mojave Air & Space Port (CA.) to see how the rules of the game are changing and what it means for the human race.
THE TRUTH ABOUT TOXINS  (airdate June 17, 2016)
In a quest to rid his life of contaminants – which are prominent in food, cleaning products and even furniture, Spurlock gets professional help to “de-tox.” The host puts his body to the test, dabbling in chelation therapy, infrared saunas, electromagnetic-free sleep chambers, and various cleanses, to see if poisons can truly be flushed out of our bodies and surroundings in the modern world.
CSI: SPURLOCK (airdate June 24, 2016)
Separating fact from TV dramatizations, Spurlock embeds in a forensic science unit to understand first-hand how crime scene investigations are actually conducted.  From the first responders, to the collection of evidence (at CSI Academy in Alachua, FL and ATF training facility in Huntsville, AL) and its analysis in the lab, he gets a crash course in Crime 101 from beginning to end.
GAME CHANGERS (airdate July 1, 2016)
Screaming fans, sold-out arenas, and teenage superstars, Spurlock joins the ranks of professional video gamers in one of the fastest-growing sectors of the “sports” world. Committed to understanding this shockingly intense industry, he joins reigning League of Legends North American Champions, from Counter Logic Gaming, as they train to compete for a big cash prize at the World Championship in Paris.
SEEK AND DISRUPT! (airdate July 8, 2016)
Inspired by companies like Google, AirBnB, and Spotify, Spurlock attempts to fill a void in the marketplace and re-write the rules by becoming the next disruptor. An eye-opening trip to Silicon Valley provides industry advice from tech giants, and examines why companies like Uber often leave a trail of enemies in their wake and questions whether this golden era of tech will solve age-old problems.

Meet CNN Digital's New VP of Programming: Mitra Kalita 
Meet Mitra Kalita. She’ll be making a big move from the left coast to the right to head up programming for CNN Digital in the coming weeks. Mitra joins CNN from the Los Angeles Times, where she is serving as the publication’s managing editor. Before that, she was the executive editor of Quartz. She’s also worked for the Wall Street Journal, Mint and the Washington Post.
In her new role as VP of Programming, Mitra will lead CNN Digital’s efforts to creatively share its journalism and storytelling across an ever-exploding array of platforms. She will oversee the News & Alerting, Special Projects, and Mobile & Off-Platform teams. Mitra will be based in the Big Apple and report to Editor-in-Chief Meredith Artley.
Since no one really likes press releases, we decided to mix things up with a Q&A. Read on and join us in welcoming Mitra to CNN: @MitraKalita.
What’s your guilty pleasure?
Chips. Uber. Bright tights. The Office. The TV show, not the place.
VP of Programming sounds like a TV title.  What does that mean for Digital?   
The success of our journalism rests on two important factors: how good is the story and how good is the distribution. How adaptive are we to different devices and different platforms? How accessible, relatable, intimate, authoritative? Technically, I will oversee the homepage, alerts, projects and planning, mobile news and off-platform partnerships and initiatives. But really, I see this job as one that collaborates across departments, time zones and mediums to maximize the reach of our journalism.
If you weren’t a journalist, what would you be doing?
I can’t think of anything else I’d rather do.

Beginning July 1, the Super Bowl XL MVP, joins the popular HLN morning crew of host Robin Meade, meteorologist Bob Van Dillen and consumer business correspondent Jennifer Westhoven.

I’m excited to be able to share my journey and my stories with our audiences, both in the US and worldwide.”
“Hines is a true champion with such a winning personality,” said Bill Galvin, SVP, Sports Programming, CNN.  “His perspective on sports extends well beyond the football field – a fresh voice we’re excited to share with HLN and CNN audiences.”
Upon his retirement in 2012 from the NFL, where here he played for 14 years with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ward trained and completed the 2013 Ironman World Championships held annually in Hawaii. He began his television career as an analyst for NBC’s Sunday primetime NFL show, Football Night in America.
He founded and operates Helping Hands Foundations both in the U.S. and Korea, and is an active participant with numerous other charities including The Caring Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and Pearl S. Buck International. Ward also started an after-school education program for kids in his home state of Georgia, where he attended Forest Park High School and went on to be a top scholar-athlete at the University of Georgia, earning All-SEC honors his senior year and finishing his college career as Georgia's second all-time receiver with 144 receptions. He currently lives in Atlanta with his wife and son.

CNN Story: 
Trump defends criticism of judge with Mexican heritage
 
Text Highlights
 
Trump on Clinton’s “thin skin” comment: “Well, first of all, I don't have thin skin, I have very, very strong, very thick skin.  And when somebody is right about me, I always - you know, if you do a report and it's not necessarily positive but you're right, I never complain. I do complain when it's a lie or when it's wrong.  But I have a strong temperament and it's a very good temperament and it's a very in control temperament or I wouldn't have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn't have built all of the things that I've been able to do in life. I mean, number one best-sellers, one of the best-selling books of all time, tremendous television success...[TAPPER]  I don't think anyone is... [TRUMP] I've been successful. Well, wait a minute, Jake. I've been successful in every business I've been in, if you think, real estate one of the most successful.  Uh, television, "The Apprentice," which is, forget it.  I mean NBC came to me.  They wanted to renew so badly you have no idea. [TAPPER]  But what does that have to do with temperament?...... [TRUMP] Oh, you can't have that success without good temperament. And I will say this.  I was thinking about the word temperament.  And we need a strong temperament in this country.  We have been led by weak people, weak ineffective people.  Countries have taken advantage of us, whether it's militarily or otherwise.  We have been taken advantage of by everybody.  We have people with weak temperaments. I have a very strong temperament.  But I have a temperament that's totally under control.  And, you know, you - she - she mentions that I'll bring us into war.  She's the one that wanted to go into Iraq.  I mean she raised her hand.  She didn't know what the hell she was doing.  She raised her hand. I said, I don't want to go into Iraq, Iraq is going to destabilize the Middle East and I was 100 percent right.”
 
 
Trump responds to criticism of judge with Mexican heritage “….[TRUMP] Do you know that these people went to every attorney general, practically, in the country that they could and do you know this case was turned down by almost every attorney general, from Texas to Florida to many of these states? [TAPPER]  Is it not, when Hillary Clinton says this is a racist attack and you reject that, if you are saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism? [TRUMP]  No, I don't think so at all. [TAPPER]  No? [TRUMP]  No.  He's proud of his heritage.  I - I respect him for that. [TAPPER]  But you're saying he can't do his job because of that. [TRUMP]  Look, he's proud of his heritage, OK.  I'm building a wall.  Now, I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. [TAPPER]  He's a legal citizen... [TRUMP]  You know why I'm going to do well with Hispanics? Because I'm going to bring back jobs and they're going to get jobs right now.  They're going to get jobs.  I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. But we're building a wall.  He's a Mexican.  We're building a wall between here and Mexico.  The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings, rulings that people can't even believe.  This case should have ended years ago on summary judgment.  The best lawyers - I have spoken to so many lawyers, they said this is not a case, this is a case that should have ended. [TAPPER]  I have... [TRUMP]  This judge is giving us unfair rulings. Now I say why? Well, I want to - I'm building a wall, OK, and it's a wall between Mexico, not another country...”

CNN to deliver comprehensive EU referendum coverage 
Multiplatform news, debate and analysis of UK’s crucial vote
London, 2 June 2016: As the UK prepares to vote on whether to remain in the European Union, CNN will offer a mix of special ‘Brexit’ programming to audiences around the world, across TV and digital platforms.
Leading up to the poll on 23 June, CNN’s most experienced journalists will be getting to grips with the issues facing UK voters, and the implications of their decision for Europe and the world.  The network will take to the UK’s roads, host an interactive debate show, and provide the latest news and reaction as the results come in.
Gill Penlington, Director of News & Event Programming, EMEA at CNN International, said: “There is so much information, misinformation, conjecture and opinion around this vitally important story.  We’ll be talking to leading lights from all angles of the debate, debunking some of the myths, and getting into the minds of the voters whose decision will have implications across the world.”
Following the story will be CNN journalists including anchors Hala Gorani, Max Foster, and Nina dos Santos, as well as Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson.  They will be joined by CNNMoney Editor at Large, Richard Quest, and Chief International Correspondent, Christiane Amanpour.
Key programming and content:
On digital:
Full coverage of the referendum can be found at CNN.com/Brexit – including explainers, opinion, and the very latest news.
On CNN International:
From Monday 13 June, Richard Quest will be taking to the UK’s roads in a 1970s campervan for a week, to get the mood on the ground.  Visiting iconic locations he will talk to voters, as well as leading voices from business, politics, academia and culture.  In addition to updates through the day on CNN International and extensive coverage on CNNMoney, Quest Means Business will also be anchored live from the campervan throughout the week at 9pm GMT/10pm CET.
On Thursday 16 June at 7pm BST/8pm CET, Christiane Amanpour will host an interactive ‘Brexit reality check’.  Recorded at the McLaren Thought Leadership Centre, UK Decides: In or Out will feature a panel of high profile guests from both sides of the debate. Max Foster will be marshalling the studio audience, who will use high tech, interactive voting technology to have their say in real time on the key issues.
On Thursday 23 June, the day of the referendum itself, CNN will present coverage throughout the day.  Then, from the moment the polls close, at 10pm GMT/11pm CET, there will be rolling coverage of the results.  Anchored live from London, with correspondents stationed in key locations in the UK and Europe, CNN will bring up-to-the-minute developments through the night as the votes are counted.  The result will then be dissected the next day, with the ramifications for the UK, Europe and the world put under the microscope.

Below are descriptions of Morgan Spurlock Inside Man season four episodes (airdates subject to change):
DOUBLE OR NOTHING (airdate June 3 2016)
Spurlock enters the seductive world of professional gambling by spending a week in Las Vegas determined to beat the house. His exploration of this pastime, which often leads to serious addiction, takes him to casinos, bookies, the racetrack, Off Track Betting and just about any place that allows him to gamble.
ONE GIANT STEP FOR MORGAN (airdate June 10, 2016)
Spurlock “virtually” experiences life as an astronaut and investigates the future of the space industry. The host’s journey takes him to government and private facilities including NASA’s Johnson Space Center (Houston), the X-Prize Foundation (Culver City, CA.) and Virgin Atlantic’s Mojave Air & Space Port (CA.) to see how the rules of the game are changing and what it means for the human race.
THE TRUTH ABOUT TOXINS  (airdate June 17, 2016)
In a quest to rid his life of contaminants – which are prominent in food, cleaning products and even furniture, Spurlock gets professional help to “de-tox.” The host puts his body to the test, dabbling in chelation therapy, infrared saunas, electromagnetic-free sleep chambers, and various cleanses, to see if poisons can truly be flushed out of our bodies and surroundings in the modern world.
CSI: SPURLOCK (airdate June 24, 2016)
Separating fact from TV dramatizations, Spurlock embeds in a forensic science unit to understand first-hand how crime scene investigations are actually conducted.  From the first responders, to the collection of evidence (at CSI Academy in Alachua, FL and ATF training facility in Huntsville, AL) and its analysis in the lab, he gets a crash course in Crime 101 from beginning to end.
GAME CHANGERS (airdate July 1, 2016)
Screaming fans, sold-out arenas, and teenage superstars, Spurlock joins the ranks of professional video gamers in one of the fastest-growing sectors of the “sports” world. Committed to understanding this shockingly intense industry, he joins reigning League of Legends North American Champions, from Counter Logic Gaming, as they train to compete for a big cash prize at the World Championship in Paris.
SEEK AND DISRUPT! (airdate July 8, 2016)
Inspired by companies like Google, AirBnB, and Spotify, Spurlock attempts to fill a void in the marketplace and re-write the rules by becoming the next disruptor. An eye-opening trip to Silicon Valley provides industry advice from tech giants, and examines why companies like Uber often leave a trail of enemies in their wake and questions whether this golden era of tech will solve age-old problems.

Meet CNN Digital's New VP of Programming: Mitra Kalita 
Meet Mitra Kalita. She’ll be making a big move from the left coast to the right to head up programming for CNN Digital in the coming weeks. Mitra joins CNN from the Los Angeles Times, where she is serving as the publication’s managing editor. Before that, she was the executive editor of Quartz. She’s also worked for the Wall Street Journal, Mint and the Washington Post.
In her new role as VP of Programming, Mitra will lead CNN Digital’s efforts to creatively share its journalism and storytelling across an ever-exploding array of platforms. She will oversee the News & Alerting, Special Projects, and Mobile & Off-Platform teams. Mitra will be based in the Big Apple and report to Editor-in-Chief Meredith Artley.
Since no one really likes press releases, we decided to mix things up with a Q&A. Read on and join us in welcoming Mitra to CNN: @MitraKalita.
What’s your guilty pleasure?
Chips. Uber. Bright tights. The Office. The TV show, not the place.
VP of Programming sounds like a TV title.  What does that mean for Digital?   
The success of our journalism rests on two important factors: how good is the story and how good is the distribution. How adaptive are we to different devices and different platforms? How accessible, relatable, intimate, authoritative? Technically, I will oversee the homepage, alerts, projects and planning, mobile news and off-platform partnerships and initiatives. But really, I see this job as one that collaborates across departments, time zones and mediums to maximize the reach of our journalism.
If you weren’t a journalist, what would you be doing?
I can’t think of anything else I’d rather do.

Two-Time Super Bowl Champ and 'Dancing with the Stars'  Mirrorball Winner Hines Ward Joins HLN’S 'Morning Express With Robin Meade' As Sports Contributor 
TWO-TIME SUPER BOWL CHAMP AND 'DANCING WITH THE STARS' MIRRORBALL WINNER HINES WARD JOINS HLN’S 'MORNING EXPRESS WITH ROBIN MEADE' AS SPORTS CONTRIBUTOR
Ward to Also Provide Sports Commentary and Analysis Across all CNN Platforms
Hines Ward, two-time Super Bowl champion and Dancing with the Stars Mirrorball trophy winner, joins HLN’s Morning Express with Robin Meade as sports contributor.  Based at the network’s headquarters in Atlanta, Ward will also provide analysis and commentary on major sporting events and breaking news across all CNN platforms, including CNN/U.S., CNN Digital, CNNMoney and CNN International.
Beginning July 1, the Super Bowl XL MVP, joins the popular HLN morning crew of host Robin Meade, meteorologist Bob Van Dillen and consumer business correspondent Jennifer Westhoven. Morning Express with Robin Meade is a ratings juggernaut for the network.  The wildly successful morning show is up double-digits year-to-date in both total viewers and persons 25-54.
“I’m incredibly grateful to HLN and CNN for welcoming me to their prestigious team,” said Ward. “Throughout my career, I’ve always envisioned myself as more than just a football player and this platform will allow me to express myself in different and unique ways. I’m excited to be able to share my journey and my stories with our audiences, both in the US and worldwide.”
“Hines is a true champion with such a winning personality,” said Bill Galvin, SVP, Sports Programming, CNN.  “His perspective on sports extends well beyond the football field – a fresh voice we’re excited to share with HLN and CNN audiences.”
Upon his retirement in 2012 from the NFL, where here he played for 14 years with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ward trained and completed the 2013 Ironman World Championships held annually in Hawaii. He began his television career as an analyst for NBC’s Sunday primetime NFL show, Football Night in America.
He founded and operates Helping Hands Foundations both in the U.S. and Korea, and is an active participant with numerous other charities including The Caring Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and Pearl S. Buck International. Ward also started an after-school education program for kids in his home state of Georgia, where he attended Forest Park High School and went on to be a top scholar-athlete at the University of Georgia, earning All-SEC honors his senior year and finishing his college career as Georgia's second all-time receiver with 144 receptions. He currently lives in Atlanta with his wife and son.
Ward is represented by CSE Talent, which offers management and career assistance to its elite roster of over 200 clients including pro and collegiate coaches, baseball players, golfers, management, and news and sport media talent.

Donald Trump hits back at Clinton's 'thin skin' comment
Donald Trump rails against judge's 'Mexican heritage'
 
CNN Story: 
Trump defends criticism of judge with Mexican heritage
 
Text Highlights
 
Trump on Clinton’s “thin skin” comment: “Well, first of all, I don't have thin skin, I have very, very strong, very thick skin.  And when somebody is right about me, I always - you know, if you do a report and it's not necessarily positive but you're right, I never complain. I do complain when it's a lie or when it's wrong.  But I have a strong temperament and it's a very good temperament and it's a very in control temperament or I wouldn't have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn't have built all of the things that I've been able to do in life. I mean, number one best-sellers, one of the best-selling books of all time, tremendous television success...[TAPPER]  I don't think anyone is... [TRUMP] I've been successful. Well, wait a minute, Jake. I've been successful in every business I've been in, if you think, real estate one of the most successful.  Uh, television, "The Apprentice," which is, forget it.  I mean NBC came to me.  They wanted to renew so badly you have no idea. [TAPPER]  But what does that have to do with temperament?...... [TRUMP] Oh, you can't have that success without good temperament. And I will say this.  I was thinking about the word temperament.  And we need a strong temperament in this country.  We have been led by weak people, weak ineffective people.  Countries have taken advantage of us, whether it's militarily or otherwise.  We have been taken advantage of by everybody.  We have people with weak temperaments. I have a very strong temperament.  But I have a temperament that's totally under control.  And, you know, you - she - she mentions that I'll bring us into war.  She's the one that wanted to go into Iraq.  I mean she raised her hand.  She didn't know what the hell she was doing.  She raised her hand. I said, I don't want to go into Iraq, Iraq is going to destabilize the Middle East and I was 100 percent right.”
 
 
Trump responds to criticism of judge with Mexican heritage “….[TRUMP] Do you know that these people went to every attorney general, practically, in the country that they could and do you know this case was turned down by almost every attorney general, from Texas to Florida to many of these states? [TAPPER]  Is it not, when Hillary Clinton says this is a racist attack and you reject that, if you are saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism? [TRUMP]  No, I don't think so at all. [TAPPER]  No? [TRUMP]  No.  He's proud of his heritage.  I - I respect him for that. [TAPPER]  But you're saying he can't do his job because of that. [TRUMP]  Look, he's proud of his heritage, OK.  I'm building a wall.  Now, I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. [TAPPER]  He's a legal citizen... [TRUMP]  You know why I'm going to do well with Hispanics? Because I'm going to bring back jobs and they're going to get jobs right now.  They're going to get jobs.  I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. But we're building a wall.  He's a Mexican.  We're building a wall between here and Mexico.  The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings, rulings that people can't even believe.  This case should have ended years ago on summary judgment.  The best lawyers - I have spoken to so many lawyers, they said this is not a case, this is a case that should have ended. [TAPPER]  I have... [TRUMP]  This judge is giving us unfair rulings. Now I say why? Well, I want to - I'm building a wall, OK, and it's a wall between Mexico, not another country...”

CNN to deliver comprehensive EU referendum coverage 
Multiplatform news, debate and analysis of UK’s crucial vote
London, 2 June 2016: As the UK prepares to vote on whether to remain in the European Union, CNN will offer a mix of special ‘Brexit’ programming to audiences around the world, across TV and digital platforms.
Leading up to the poll on 23 June, CNN’s most experienced journalists will be getting to grips with the issues facing UK voters, and the implications of their decision for Europe and the world.  The network will take to the UK’s roads, host an interactive debate show, and provide the latest news and reaction as the results come in.
Gill Penlington, Director of News & Event Programming, EMEA at CNN International, said: “There is so much information, misinformation, conjecture and opinion around this vitally important story.  We’ll be talking to leading lights from all angles of the debate, debunking some of the myths, and getting into the minds of the voters whose decision will have implications across the world.”
Following the story will be CNN journalists including anchors Hala Gorani, Max Foster, and Nina dos Santos, as well as Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson.  They will be joined by CNNMoney Editor at Large, Richard Quest, and Chief International Correspondent, Christiane Amanpour.
Key programming and content:
On digital:
Full coverage of the referendum can be found at CNN.com/Brexit – including explainers, opinion, and the very latest news.
On CNN International:
From Monday 13 June, Richard Quest will be taking to the UK’s roads in a 1970s campervan for a week, to get the mood on the ground.  Visiting iconic locations he will talk to voters, as well as leading voices from business, politics, academia and culture.  In addition to updates through the day on CNN International and extensive coverage on CNNMoney, Quest Means Business will also be anchored live from the campervan throughout the week at 9pm GMT/10pm CET.
On Thursday 16 June at 7pm BST/8pm CET, Christiane Amanpour will host an interactive ‘Brexit reality check’.  Recorded at the McLaren Thought Leadership Centre, UK Decides: In or Out will feature a panel of high profile guests from both sides of the debate. Max Foster will be marshalling the studio audience, who will use high tech, interactive voting technology to have their say in real time on the key issues.
On Thursday 23 June, the day of the referendum itself, CNN will present coverage throughout the day.  Then, from the moment the polls close, at 10pm GMT/11pm CET, there will be rolling coverage of the results.  Anchored live from London, with correspondents stationed in key locations in the UK and Europe, CNN will bring up-to-the-minute developments through the night as the votes are counted.  The result will then be dissected the next day, with the ramifications for the UK, Europe and the world put under the microscope.
ENDS

Update! Season Four Premiere of CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man Launches Friday, June 3, 10pm, ET/PT 
New Season Includes Spurlock’s Inside Look at Space, Gambling, Toxins, Disruptors, CSI and Gamers
Popular CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man, hosted and produced by the Oscar®-nominated documentary filmmaker, launches its fourth season on Friday, June 3 at 10pm ET/PT with an inside look at professional gambling.
In his inimitable, inquisitive style, and with a sense of humor intact, Spurlock tells compelling stories from an insider’s perspective. In the new season Morgan tackles toxins, gambling, the space industry, disruptors, gaming, and crime scene investigations.
The multiple award-winning program averaged 546,000 total viewers and 244,000 Adults 25-54 for premiere episodes in season three (1/22-3/19/15) and posted its highest season performance ever among both Adults 25-54 and total viewers. It surpassed its season two average (airing on Sundays at 10pm) by 7% in Adults 25-54 (228,000) and 27% in total viewers (429,000).*
For embeddable clips from the new season, please click on the following link:  http://www.cnn.com/shows/inside-man
Below are descriptions of Morgan Spurlock Inside Man season four episodes (airdates subject to change):
DOUBLE OR NOTHING (airdate June 3 2016)
Spurlock enters the seductive world of professional gambling by spending a week in Las Vegas determined to beat the house. His exploration of this pastime, which often leads to serious addiction, takes him to casinos, bookies, the racetrack, Off Track Betting and just about any place that allows him to gamble.
ONE GIANT STEP FOR MORGAN (airdate June 10, 2016)
Spurlock “virtually” experiences life as an astronaut and investigates the future of the space industry. The host’s journey takes him to government and private facilities including NASA’s Johnson Space Center (Houston), the X-Prize Foundation (Culver City, CA.) and Virgin Atlantic’s Mojave Air & Space Port (CA.) to see how the rules of the game are changing and what it means for the human race.
THE TRUTH ABOUT TOXINS  (airdate June 17, 2016)
In a quest to rid his life of contaminants – which are prominent in food, cleaning products and even furniture, Spurlock gets professional help to “de-tox.” The host puts his body to the test, dabbling in chelation therapy, infrared saunas, electromagnetic-free sleep chambers, and various cleanses, to see if poisons can truly be flushed out of our bodies and surroundings in the modern world.
CSI: SPURLOCK (airdate June 24, 2016)
Separating fact from TV dramatizations, Spurlock embeds in a forensic science unit to understand first-hand how crime scene investigations are actually conducted.  From the first responders, to the collection of evidence (at CSI Academy in Alachua, FL and ATF training facility in Huntsville, AL) and its analysis in the lab, he gets a crash course in Crime 101 from beginning to end.
GAME CHANGERS (airdate July 1, 2016)
Screaming fans, sold-out arenas, and teenage superstars, Spurlock joins the ranks of professional video gamers in one of the fastest-growing sectors of the “sports” world. Committed to understanding this shockingly intense industry, he joins reigning League of Legends North American Champions, from Counter Logic Gaming, as they train to compete for a big cash prize at the World Championship in Paris.
SEEK AND DISRUPT! (airdate July 8, 2016)
Inspired by companies like Google, AirBnB, and Spotify, Spurlock attempts to fill a void in the marketplace and re-write the rules by becoming the next disruptor. An eye-opening trip to Silicon Valley provides industry advice from tech giants, and examines why companies like Uber often leave a trail of enemies in their wake and questions whether this golden era of tech will solve age-old problems.

Meet CNN Digital's New VP of Programming: Mitra Kalita 
Meet Mitra Kalita. She’ll be making a big move from the left coast to the right to head up programming for CNN Digital in the coming weeks. Mitra joins CNN from the Los Angeles Times, where she is serving as the publication’s managing editor. Before that, she was the executive editor of Quartz. She’s also worked for the Wall Street Journal, Mint and the Washington Post.
In her new role as VP of Programming, Mitra will lead CNN Digital’s efforts to creatively share its journalism and storytelling across an ever-exploding array of platforms. She will oversee the News & Alerting, Special Projects, and Mobile & Off-Platform teams. Mitra will be based in the Big Apple and report to Editor-in-Chief Meredith Artley.
Since no one really likes press releases, we decided to mix things up with a Q&A. Read on and join us in welcoming Mitra to CNN: @MitraKalita.
What’s your guilty pleasure?
Chips. Uber. Bright tights. The Office. The TV show, not the place.
VP of Programming sounds like a TV title.  What does that mean for Digital?   
The success of our journalism rests on two important factors: how good is the story and how good is the distribution. How adaptive are we to different devices and different platforms? How accessible, relatable, intimate, authoritative? Technically, I will oversee the homepage, alerts, projects and planning, mobile news and off-platform partnerships and initiatives. But really, I see this job as one that collaborates across departments, time zones and mediums to maximize the reach of our journalism.
If you weren’t a journalist, what would you be doing?
I can’t think of anything else I’d rather do.

He began his television career as an analyst for NBC’s Sunday primetime NFL show, Football Night in America.
He founded and operates Helping Hands Foundations both in the U.S. and Korea, and is an active participant with numerous other charities including The Caring Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and Pearl S. Buck International. Ward also started an after-school education program for kids in his home state of Georgia, where he attended Forest Park High School and went on to be a top scholar-athlete at the University of Georgia, earning All-SEC honors his senior year and finishing his college career as Georgia's second all-time receiver with 144 receptions. He currently lives in Atlanta with his wife and son.

Text Highlights
 
Trump on Clinton’s “thin skin” comment: “Well, first of all, I don't have thin skin, I have very, very strong, very thick skin.  And when somebody is right about me, I always - you know, if you do a report and it's not necessarily positive but you're right, I never complain.

And I will say this.  I was thinking about the word temperament.  And we need a strong temperament in this country.  We have been led by weak people, weak ineffective people.  Countries have taken advantage of us, whether it's militarily or otherwise.  We have been taken advantage of by everybody.  We have people with weak temperaments. I have a very strong temperament.  But I have a temperament that's totally under control.  And, you know, you - she - she mentions that I'll bring us into war.  She's the one that wanted to go into Iraq.  I mean she raised her hand.  She didn't know what the hell she was doing.  She raised her hand.

[TRUMP]  Look, he's proud of his heritage, OK.  I'm building a wall.  Now, I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. [TAPPER]  He's a legal citizen... [TRUMP]  You know why I'm going to do well with Hispanics? Because I'm going to bring back jobs and they're going to get jobs right now.  They're going to get jobs.  I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. But we're building a wall.  He's a Mexican.  We're building a wall between here and Mexico.  The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings, rulings that people can't even believe.  This case should have ended years ago on summary judgment.  The best lawyers - I have spoken to so many lawyers, they said this is not a case, this is a case that should have ended. [TAPPER]  I have... [TRUMP]  This judge is giving us unfair rulings. Now I say why? Well, I want to - I'm building a wall, OK, and it's a wall between Mexico, not another country...”

CNN to deliver comprehensive EU referendum coverage 
Multiplatform news, debate and analysis of UK’s crucial vote
London, 2 June 2016: As the UK prepares to vote on whether to remain in the European Union, CNN will offer a mix of special ‘Brexit’ programming to audiences around the world, across TV and digital platforms.
Leading up to the poll on 23 June, CNN’s most experienced journalists will be getting to grips with the issues facing UK voters, and the implications of their decision for Europe and the world.  The network will take to the UK’s roads, host an interactive debate show, and provide the latest news and reaction as the results come in.
Gill Penlington, Director of News & Event Programming, EMEA at CNN International, said: “There is so much information, misinformation, conjecture and opinion around this vitally important story.  We’ll be talking to leading lights from all angles of the debate, debunking some of the myths, and getting into the minds of the voters whose decision will have implications across the world.”
Following the story will be CNN journalists including anchors Hala Gorani, Max Foster, and Nina dos Santos, as well as Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson.  They will be joined by CNNMoney Editor at Large, Richard Quest, and Chief International Correspondent, Christiane Amanpour.
Key programming and content:
On digital:
Full coverage of the referendum can be found at CNN.com/Brexit – including explainers, opinion, and the very latest news.
On CNN International:
From Monday 13 June, Richard Quest will be taking to the UK’s roads in a 1970s campervan for a week, to get the mood on the ground.  Visiting iconic locations he will talk to voters, as well as leading voices from business, politics, academia and culture.  In addition to updates through the day on CNN International and extensive coverage on CNNMoney, Quest Means Business will also be anchored live from the campervan throughout the week at 9pm GMT/10pm CET.
On Thursday 16 June at 7pm BST/8pm CET, Christiane Amanpour will host an interactive ‘Brexit reality check’.  Recorded at the McLaren Thought Leadership Centre, UK Decides: In or Out will feature a panel of high profile guests from both sides of the debate. Max Foster will be marshalling the studio audience, who will use high tech, interactive voting technology to have their say in real time on the key issues.
On Thursday 23 June, the day of the referendum itself, CNN will present coverage throughout the day.  Then, from the moment the polls close, at 10pm GMT/11pm CET, there will be rolling coverage of the results.  Anchored live from London, with correspondents stationed in key locations in the UK and Europe, CNN will bring up-to-the-minute developments through the night as the votes are counted.  The result will then be dissected the next day, with the ramifications for the UK, Europe and the world put under the microscope.

Popular CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man, hosted and produced by the Oscar®-nominated documentary filmmaker, launches its fourth season on Friday, June 3 at 10pm ET/PT with an inside look at professional gambling.
In his inimitable, inquisitive style, and with a sense of humor intact, Spurlock tells compelling stories from an insider’s perspective. In the new season Morgan tackles toxins, gambling, the space industry, disruptors, gaming, and crime scene investigations.
The multiple award-winning program averaged 546,000 total viewers and 244,000 Adults 25-54 for premiere episodes in season three (1/22-3/19/15) and posted its highest season performance ever among both Adults 25-54 and total viewers. It surpassed its season two average (airing on Sundays at 10pm) by 7% in Adults 25-54 (228,000) and 27% in total viewers (429,000).*
For embeddable clips from the new season, please click on the following link:  http://www.cnn.com/shows/inside-man
Below are descriptions of Morgan Spurlock Inside Man season four episodes (airdates subject to change):
DOUBLE OR NOTHING (airdate June 3 2016)
Spurlock enters the seductive world of professional gambling by spending a week in Las Vegas determined to beat the house. His exploration of this pastime, which often leads to serious addiction, takes him to casinos, bookies, the racetrack, Off Track Betting and just about any place that allows him to gamble.
ONE GIANT STEP FOR MORGAN (airdate June 10, 2016)
Spurlock “virtually” experiences life as an astronaut and investigates the future of the space industry. The host’s journey takes him to government and private facilities including NASA’s Johnson Space Center (Houston), the X-Prize Foundation (Culver City, CA.) and Virgin Atlantic’s Mojave Air & Space Port (CA.) to see how the rules of the game are changing and what it means for the human race.
THE TRUTH ABOUT TOXINS  (airdate June 17, 2016)
In a quest to rid his life of contaminants – which are prominent in food, cleaning products and even furniture, Spurlock gets professional help to “de-tox.” The host puts his body to the test, dabbling in chelation therapy, infrared saunas, electromagnetic-free sleep chambers, and various cleanses, to see if poisons can truly be flushed out of our bodies and surroundings in the modern world.
CSI: SPURLOCK (airdate June 24, 2016)
Separating fact from TV dramatizations, Spurlock embeds in a forensic science unit to understand first-hand how crime scene investigations are actually conducted.  From the first responders, to the collection of evidence (at CSI Academy in Alachua, FL and ATF training facility in Huntsville, AL) and its analysis in the lab, he gets a crash course in Crime 101 from beginning to end.
GAME CHANGERS (airdate July 1, 2016)
Screaming fans, sold-out arenas, and teenage superstars, Spurlock joins the ranks of professional video gamers in one of the fastest-growing sectors of the “sports” world. Committed to understanding this shockingly intense industry, he joins reigning League of Legends North American Champions, from Counter Logic Gaming, as they train to compete for a big cash prize at the World Championship in Paris.
SEEK AND DISRUPT! (airdate July 8, 2016)
Inspired by companies like Google, AirBnB, and Spotify, Spurlock attempts to fill a void in the marketplace and re-write the rules by becoming the next disruptor. An eye-opening trip to Silicon Valley provides industry advice from tech giants, and examines why companies like Uber often leave a trail of enemies in their wake and questions whether this golden era of tech will solve age-old problems.

Meet CNN Digital's New VP of Programming: Mitra Kalita 
Meet Mitra Kalita. She’ll be making a big move from the left coast to the right to head up programming for CNN Digital in the coming weeks. Mitra joins CNN from the Los Angeles Times, where she is serving as the publication’s managing editor. Before that, she was the executive editor of Quartz. She’s also worked for the Wall Street Journal, Mint and the Washington Post.
In her new role as VP of Programming, Mitra will lead CNN Digital’s efforts to creatively share its journalism and storytelling across an ever-exploding array of platforms. She will oversee the News & Alerting, Special Projects, and Mobile & Off-Platform teams. Mitra will be based in the Big Apple and report to Editor-in-Chief Meredith Artley.
Since no one really likes press releases, we decided to mix things up with a Q&A. Read on and join us in welcoming Mitra to CNN: @MitraKalita.
What’s your guilty pleasure?
Chips. Uber. Bright tights. The Office. The TV show, not the place.
VP of Programming sounds like a TV title.  What does that mean for Digital?   
The success of our journalism rests on two important factors: how good is the story and how good is the distribution. How adaptive are we to different devices and different platforms? How accessible, relatable, intimate, authoritative? Technically, I will oversee the homepage, alerts, projects and planning, mobile news and off-platform partnerships and initiatives. But really, I see this job as one that collaborates across departments, time zones and mediums to maximize the reach of our journalism.
If you weren’t a journalist, what would you be doing?
I can’t think of anything else I’d rather do.

Ward to Also Provide Sports Commentary and Analysis Across all CNN Platforms

“I’m incredibly grateful to HLN and CNN for welcoming me to their prestigious team,” said Ward. “Throughout my career, I’ve always envisioned myself as more than just a football player and this platform will allow me to express myself in different and unique ways. I’m excited to be able to share my journey and my stories with our audiences, both in the US and worldwide.”
“Hines is a true champion with such a winning personality,” said Bill Galvin, SVP, Sports Programming, CNN.  “His perspective on sports extends well beyond the football field – a fresh voice we’re excited to share with HLN and CNN audiences.”
Upon his retirement in 2012 from the NFL, where here he played for 14 years with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ward trained and completed the 2013 Ironman World Championships held annually in Hawaii. He began his television career as an analyst for NBC’s Sunday primetime NFL show, Football Night in America.
He founded and operates Helping Hands Foundations both in the U.S. and Korea, and is an active participant with numerous other charities including The Caring Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and Pearl S. Buck International. Ward also started an after-school education program for kids in his home state of Georgia, where he attended Forest Park High School and went on to be a top scholar-athlete at the University of Georgia, earning All-SEC honors his senior year and finishing his college career as Georgia's second all-time receiver with 144 receptions. He currently lives in Atlanta with his wife and son.
Ward is represented by CSE Talent, which offers management and career assistance to its elite roster of over 200 clients including pro and collegiate coaches, baseball players, golfers, management, and news and sport media talent.

Donald Trump hits back at Clinton's 'thin skin' comment

CNN Story: 
Trump defends criticism of judge with Mexican heritage
 
Text Highlights
 
Trump on Clinton’s “thin skin” comment: “Well, first of all, I don't have thin skin, I have very, very strong, very thick skin.  And when somebody is right about me, I always - you know, if you do a report and it's not necessarily positive but you're right, I never complain. I do complain when it's a lie or when it's wrong.  But I have a strong temperament and it's a very good temperament and it's a very in control temperament or I wouldn't have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn't have built all of the things that I've been able to do in life. I mean, number one best-sellers, one of the best-selling books of all time, tremendous television success...[TAPPER]  I don't think anyone is... [TRUMP] I've been successful. Well, wait a minute, Jake. I've been successful in every business I've been in, if you think, real estate one of the most successful.  Uh, television, "The Apprentice," which is, forget it.  I mean NBC came to me.  They wanted to renew so badly you have no idea. [TAPPER]  But what does that have to do with temperament?...... [TRUMP] Oh, you can't have that success without good temperament. And I will say this.  I was thinking about the word temperament.  And we need a strong temperament in this country.  We have been led by weak people, weak ineffective people.  Countries have taken advantage of us, whether it's militarily or otherwise.  We have been taken advantage of by everybody.  We have people with weak temperaments. I have a very strong temperament.  But I have a temperament that's totally under control.  And, you know, you - she - she mentions that I'll bring us into war.  She's the one that wanted to go into Iraq.  I mean she raised her hand.  She didn't know what the hell she was doing.  She raised her hand. I said, I don't want to go into Iraq, Iraq is going to destabilize the Middle East and I was 100 percent right.”
 
 
Trump responds to criticism of judge with Mexican heritage “….[TRUMP] Do you know that these people went to every attorney general, practically, in the country that they could and do you know this case was turned down by almost every attorney general, from Texas to Florida to many of these states? [TAPPER]  Is it not, when Hillary Clinton says this is a racist attack and you reject that, if you are saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism? [TRUMP]  No, I don't think so at all. [TAPPER]  No? [TRUMP]  No.  He's proud of his heritage.  I - I respect him for that. [TAPPER]  But you're saying he can't do his job because of that. [TRUMP]  Look, he's proud of his heritage, OK.  I'm building a wall.  Now, I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. [TAPPER]  He's a legal citizen... [TRUMP]  You know why I'm going to do well with Hispanics? Because I'm going to bring back jobs and they're going to get jobs right now.  They're going to get jobs.  I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. But we're building a wall.  He's a Mexican.  We're building a wall between here and Mexico.  The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings, rulings that people can't even believe.  This case should have ended years ago on summary judgment.  The best lawyers - I have spoken to so many lawyers, they said this is not a case, this is a case that should have ended. [TAPPER]  I have... [TRUMP]  This judge is giving us unfair rulings. Now I say why? Well, I want to - I'm building a wall, OK, and it's a wall between Mexico, not another country...”

CNN to deliver comprehensive EU referendum coverage 
Multiplatform news, debate and analysis of UK’s crucial vote
London, 2 June 2016: As the UK prepares to vote on whether to remain in the European Union, CNN will offer a mix of special ‘Brexit’ programming to audiences around the world, across TV and digital platforms.
Leading up to the poll on 23 June, CNN’s most experienced journalists will be getting to grips with the issues facing UK voters, and the implications of their decision for Europe and the world.  The network will take to the UK’s roads, host an interactive debate show, and provide the latest news and reaction as the results come in.
Gill Penlington, Director of News & Event Programming, EMEA at CNN International, said: “There is so much information, misinformation, conjecture and opinion around this vitally important story.  We’ll be talking to leading lights from all angles of the debate, debunking some of the myths, and getting into the minds of the voters whose decision will have implications across the world.”
Following the story will be CNN journalists including anchors Hala Gorani, Max Foster, and Nina dos Santos, as well as Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson.  They will be joined by CNNMoney Editor at Large, Richard Quest, and Chief International Correspondent, Christiane Amanpour.
Key programming and content:
On digital:
Full coverage of the referendum can be found at CNN.com/Brexit – including explainers, opinion, and the very latest news.
On CNN International:
From Monday 13 June, Richard Quest will be taking to the UK’s roads in a 1970s campervan for a week, to get the mood on the ground.  Visiting iconic locations he will talk to voters, as well as leading voices from business, politics, academia and culture.  In addition to updates through the day on CNN International and extensive coverage on CNNMoney, Quest Means Business will also be anchored live from the campervan throughout the week at 9pm GMT/10pm CET.
On Thursday 16 June at 7pm BST/8pm CET, Christiane Amanpour will host an interactive ‘Brexit reality check’.  Recorded at the McLaren Thought Leadership Centre, UK Decides: In or Out will feature a panel of high profile guests from both sides of the debate. Max Foster will be marshalling the studio audience, who will use high tech, interactive voting technology to have their say in real time on the key issues.
On Thursday 23 June, the day of the referendum itself, CNN will present coverage throughout the day.  Then, from the moment the polls close, at 10pm GMT/11pm CET, there will be rolling coverage of the results.  Anchored live from London, with correspondents stationed in key locations in the UK and Europe, CNN will bring up-to-the-minute developments through the night as the votes are counted.  The result will then be dissected the next day, with the ramifications for the UK, Europe and the world put under the microscope.
ENDS

Update! Season Four Premiere of CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man Launches Friday, June 3, 10pm, ET/PT 
New Season Includes Spurlock’s Inside Look at Space, Gambling, Toxins, Disruptors, CSI and Gamers
Popular CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man, hosted and produced by the Oscar®-nominated documentary filmmaker, launches its fourth season on Friday, June 3 at 10pm ET/PT with an inside look at professional gambling.
In his inimitable, inquisitive style, and with a sense of humor intact, Spurlock tells compelling stories from an insider’s perspective. In the new season Morgan tackles toxins, gambling, the space industry, disruptors, gaming, and crime scene investigations.
The multiple award-winning program averaged 546,000 total viewers and 244,000 Adults 25-54 for premiere episodes in season three (1/22-3/19/15) and posted its highest season performance ever among both Adults 25-54 and total viewers. It surpassed its season two average (airing on Sundays at 10pm) by 7% in Adults 25-54 (228,000) and 27% in total viewers (429,000).*
For embeddable clips from the new season, please click on the following link:  http://www.cnn.com/shows/inside-man
Below are descriptions of Morgan Spurlock Inside Man season four episodes (airdates subject to change):
DOUBLE OR NOTHING (airdate June 3 2016)
Spurlock enters the seductive world of professional gambling by spending a week in Las Vegas determined to beat the house. His exploration of this pastime, which often leads to serious addiction, takes him to casinos, bookies, the racetrack, Off Track Betting and just about any place that allows him to gamble.
ONE GIANT STEP FOR MORGAN (airdate June 10, 2016)
Spurlock “virtually” experiences life as an astronaut and investigates the future of the space industry. The host’s journey takes him to government and private facilities including NASA’s Johnson Space Center (Houston), the X-Prize Foundation (Culver City, CA.) and Virgin Atlantic’s Mojave Air & Space Port (CA.) to see how the rules of the game are changing and what it means for the human race.
THE TRUTH ABOUT TOXINS  (airdate June 17, 2016)
In a quest to rid his life of contaminants – which are prominent in food, cleaning products and even furniture, Spurlock gets professional help to “de-tox.” The host puts his body to the test, dabbling in chelation therapy, infrared saunas, electromagnetic-free sleep chambers, and various cleanses, to see if poisons can truly be flushed out of our bodies and surroundings in the modern world.
CSI: SPURLOCK (airdate June 24, 2016)
Separating fact from TV dramatizations, Spurlock embeds in a forensic science unit to understand first-hand how crime scene investigations are actually conducted.  From the first responders, to the collection of evidence (at CSI Academy in Alachua, FL and ATF training facility in Huntsville, AL) and its analysis in the lab, he gets a crash course in Crime 101 from beginning to end.
GAME CHANGERS (airdate July 1, 2016)
Screaming fans, sold-out arenas, and teenage superstars, Spurlock joins the ranks of professional video gamers in one of the fastest-growing sectors of the “sports” world. Committed to understanding this shockingly intense industry, he joins reigning League of Legends North American Champions, from Counter Logic Gaming, as they train to compete for a big cash prize at the World Championship in Paris.
SEEK AND DISRUPT! (airdate July 8, 2016)
Inspired by companies like Google, AirBnB, and Spotify, Spurlock attempts to fill a void in the marketplace and re-write the rules by becoming the next disruptor. An eye-opening trip to Silicon Valley provides industry advice from tech giants, and examines why companies like Uber often leave a trail of enemies in their wake and questions whether this golden era of tech will solve age-old problems.

Meet CNN Digital's New VP of Programming: Mitra Kalita 
Meet Mitra Kalita. She’ll be making a big move from the left coast to the right to head up programming for CNN Digital in the coming weeks. Mitra joins CNN from the Los Angeles Times, where she is serving as the publication’s managing editor. Before that, she was the executive editor of Quartz. She’s also worked for the Wall Street Journal, Mint and the Washington Post.
In her new role as VP of Programming, Mitra will lead CNN Digital’s efforts to creatively share its journalism and storytelling across an ever-exploding array of platforms. She will oversee the News & Alerting, Special Projects, and Mobile & Off-Platform teams. Mitra will be based in the Big Apple and report to Editor-in-Chief Meredith Artley.
Since no one really likes press releases, we decided to mix things up with a Q&A. Read on and join us in welcoming Mitra to CNN: @MitraKalita.
What’s your guilty pleasure?
Chips. Uber. Bright tights. The Office. The TV show, not the place.
VP of Programming sounds like a TV title.  What does that mean for Digital?   
The success of our journalism rests on two important factors: how good is the story and how good is the distribution. How adaptive are we to different devices and different platforms? How accessible, relatable, intimate, authoritative? Technically, I will oversee the homepage, alerts, projects and planning, mobile news and off-platform partnerships and initiatives. But really, I see this job as one that collaborates across departments, time zones and mediums to maximize the reach of our journalism.
If you weren’t a journalist, what would you be doing?
I can’t think of anything else I’d rather do.

I’m excited to be able to share my journey and my stories with our audiences, both in the US and worldwide.”
“Hines is a true champion with such a winning personality,” said Bill Galvin, SVP, Sports Programming, CNN.  “His perspective on sports extends well beyond the football field – a fresh voice we’re excited to share with HLN and CNN audiences.”
Upon his retirement in 2012 from the NFL, where here he played for 14 years with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ward trained and completed the 2013 Ironman World Championships held annually in Hawaii. He began his television career as an analyst for NBC’s Sunday primetime NFL show, Football Night in America.
He founded and operates Helping Hands Foundations both in the U.S. and Korea, and is an active participant with numerous other charities including The Caring Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and Pearl S. Buck International. Ward also started an after-school education program for kids in his home state of Georgia, where he attended Forest Park High School and went on to be a top scholar-athlete at the University of Georgia, earning All-SEC honors his senior year and finishing his college career as Georgia's second all-time receiver with 144 receptions. He currently lives in Atlanta with his wife and son.
Ward is represented by CSE Talent, which offers management and career assistance to its elite roster of over 200 clients including pro and collegiate coaches, baseball players, golfers, management, and news and sport media talent.

Trump defends criticism of judge with Mexican heritage
 
Text Highlights
 
Trump on Clinton’s “thin skin” comment: “Well, first of all, I don't have thin skin, I have very, very strong, very thick skin.  And when somebody is right about me, I always - you know, if you do a report and it's not necessarily positive but you're right, I never complain. I do complain when it's a lie or when it's wrong.  But I have a strong temperament and it's a very good temperament and it's a very in control temperament or I wouldn't have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn't have built all of the things that I've been able to do in life. I mean, number one best-sellers, one of the best-selling books of all time, tremendous television success...[TAPPER]  I don't think anyone is... [TRUMP] I've been successful. Well, wait a minute, Jake. I've been successful in every business I've been in, if you think, real estate one of the most successful.  Uh, television, "The Apprentice," which is, forget it.  I mean NBC came to me.  They wanted to renew so badly you have no idea. [TAPPER]  But what does that have to do with temperament?...... [TRUMP] Oh, you can't have that success without good temperament. And I will say this.  I was thinking about the word temperament.  And we need a strong temperament in this country.  We have been led by weak people, weak ineffective people.  Countries have taken advantage of us, whether it's militarily or otherwise.  We have been taken advantage of by everybody.  We have people with weak temperaments. I have a very strong temperament.  But I have a temperament that's totally under control.  And, you know, you - she - she mentions that I'll bring us into war.  She's the one that wanted to go into Iraq.  I mean she raised her hand.  She didn't know what the hell she was doing.  She raised her hand. I said, I don't want to go into Iraq, Iraq is going to destabilize the Middle East and I was 100 percent right.”
 
 
Trump responds to criticism of judge with Mexican heritage “….[TRUMP] Do you know that these people went to every attorney general, practically, in the country that they could and do you know this case was turned down by almost every attorney general, from Texas to Florida to many of these states? [TAPPER]  Is it not, when Hillary Clinton says this is a racist attack and you reject that, if you are saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism? [TRUMP]  No, I don't think so at all. [TAPPER]  No? [TRUMP]  No.  He's proud of his heritage.  I - I respect him for that. [TAPPER]  But you're saying he can't do his job because of that. [TRUMP]  Look, he's proud of his heritage, OK.  I'm building a wall.  Now, I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. [TAPPER]  He's a legal citizen... [TRUMP]  You know why I'm going to do well with Hispanics? Because I'm going to bring back jobs and they're going to get jobs right now.  They're going to get jobs.  I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. But we're building a wall.  He's a Mexican.  We're building a wall between here and Mexico.  The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings, rulings that people can't even believe.  This case should have ended years ago on summary judgment.  The best lawyers - I have spoken to so many lawyers, they said this is not a case, this is a case that should have ended. [TAPPER]  I have... [TRUMP]  This judge is giving us unfair rulings. Now I say why? Well, I want to - I'm building a wall, OK, and it's a wall between Mexico, not another country...”

CNN to deliver comprehensive EU referendum coverage 
Multiplatform news, debate and analysis of UK’s crucial vote
London, 2 June 2016: As the UK prepares to vote on whether to remain in the European Union, CNN will offer a mix of special ‘Brexit’ programming to audiences around the world, across TV and digital platforms.
Leading up to the poll on 23 June, CNN’s most experienced journalists will be getting to grips with the issues facing UK voters, and the implications of their decision for Europe and the world.  The network will take to the UK’s roads, host an interactive debate show, and provide the latest news and reaction as the results come in.
Gill Penlington, Director of News & Event Programming, EMEA at CNN International, said: “There is so much information, misinformation, conjecture and opinion around this vitally important story.  We’ll be talking to leading lights from all angles of the debate, debunking some of the myths, and getting into the minds of the voters whose decision will have implications across the world.”
Following the story will be CNN journalists including anchors Hala Gorani, Max Foster, and Nina dos Santos, as well as Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson.  They will be joined by CNNMoney Editor at Large, Richard Quest, and Chief International Correspondent, Christiane Amanpour.
Key programming and content:
On digital:
Full coverage of the referendum can be found at CNN.com/Brexit – including explainers, opinion, and the very latest news.
On CNN International:
From Monday 13 June, Richard Quest will be taking to the UK’s roads in a 1970s campervan for a week, to get the mood on the ground.  Visiting iconic locations he will talk to voters, as well as leading voices from business, politics, academia and culture.  In addition to updates through the day on CNN International and extensive coverage on CNNMoney, Quest Means Business will also be anchored live from the campervan throughout the week at 9pm GMT/10pm CET.
On Thursday 16 June at 7pm BST/8pm CET, Christiane Amanpour will host an interactive ‘Brexit reality check’.  Recorded at the McLaren Thought Leadership Centre, UK Decides: In or Out will feature a panel of high profile guests from both sides of the debate. Max Foster will be marshalling the studio audience, who will use high tech, interactive voting technology to have their say in real time on the key issues.
On Thursday 23 June, the day of the referendum itself, CNN will present coverage throughout the day.  Then, from the moment the polls close, at 10pm GMT/11pm CET, there will be rolling coverage of the results.  Anchored live from London, with correspondents stationed in key locations in the UK and Europe, CNN will bring up-to-the-minute developments through the night as the votes are counted.  The result will then be dissected the next day, with the ramifications for the UK, Europe and the world put under the microscope.

Update! Season Four Premiere of CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man Launches Friday, June 3, 10pm, ET/PT 
New Season Includes Spurlock’s Inside Look at Space, Gambling, Toxins, Disruptors, CSI and Gamers
Popular CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man, hosted and produced by the Oscar®-nominated documentary filmmaker, launches its fourth season on Friday, June 3 at 10pm ET/PT with an inside look at professional gambling.
In his inimitable, inquisitive style, and with a sense of humor intact, Spurlock tells compelling stories from an insider’s perspective. In the new season Morgan tackles toxins, gambling, the space industry, disruptors, gaming, and crime scene investigations.
The multiple award-winning program averaged 546,000 total viewers and 244,000 Adults 25-54 for premiere episodes in season three (1/22-3/19/15) and posted its highest season performance ever among both Adults 25-54 and total viewers. It surpassed its season two average (airing on Sundays at 10pm) by 7% in Adults 25-54 (228,000) and 27% in total viewers (429,000).*
For embeddable clips from the new season, please click on the following link:  http://www.cnn.com/shows/inside-man
Below are descriptions of Morgan Spurlock Inside Man season four episodes (airdates subject to change):
DOUBLE OR NOTHING (airdate June 3 2016)
Spurlock enters the seductive world of professional gambling by spending a week in Las Vegas determined to beat the house. His exploration of this pastime, which often leads to serious addiction, takes him to casinos, bookies, the racetrack, Off Track Betting and just about any place that allows him to gamble.
ONE GIANT STEP FOR MORGAN (airdate June 10, 2016)
Spurlock “virtually” experiences life as an astronaut and investigates the future of the space industry. The host’s journey takes him to government and private facilities including NASA’s Johnson Space Center (Houston), the X-Prize Foundation (Culver City, CA.) and Virgin Atlantic’s Mojave Air & Space Port (CA.) to see how the rules of the game are changing and what it means for the human race.
THE TRUTH ABOUT TOXINS  (airdate June 17, 2016)
In a quest to rid his life of contaminants – which are prominent in food, cleaning products and even furniture, Spurlock gets professional help to “de-tox.” The host puts his body to the test, dabbling in chelation therapy, infrared saunas, electromagnetic-free sleep chambers, and various cleanses, to see if poisons can truly be flushed out of our bodies and surroundings in the modern world.
CSI: SPURLOCK (airdate June 24, 2016)
Separating fact from TV dramatizations, Spurlock embeds in a forensic science unit to understand first-hand how crime scene investigations are actually conducted.  From the first responders, to the collection of evidence (at CSI Academy in Alachua, FL and ATF training facility in Huntsville, AL) and its analysis in the lab, he gets a crash course in Crime 101 from beginning to end.
GAME CHANGERS (airdate July 1, 2016)
Screaming fans, sold-out arenas, and teenage superstars, Spurlock joins the ranks of professional video gamers in one of the fastest-growing sectors of the “sports” world. Committed to understanding this shockingly intense industry, he joins reigning League of Legends North American Champions, from Counter Logic Gaming, as they train to compete for a big cash prize at the World Championship in Paris.
SEEK AND DISRUPT! (airdate July 8, 2016)
Inspired by companies like Google, AirBnB, and Spotify, Spurlock attempts to fill a void in the marketplace and re-write the rules by becoming the next disruptor. An eye-opening trip to Silicon Valley provides industry advice from tech giants, and examines why companies like Uber often leave a trail of enemies in their wake and questions whether this golden era of tech will solve age-old problems.

Meet CNN Digital's New VP of Programming: Mitra Kalita 
Meet Mitra Kalita. She’ll be making a big move from the left coast to the right to head up programming for CNN Digital in the coming weeks. Mitra joins CNN from the Los Angeles Times, where she is serving as the publication’s managing editor. Before that, she was the executive editor of Quartz. She’s also worked for the Wall Street Journal, Mint and the Washington Post.
In her new role as VP of Programming, Mitra will lead CNN Digital’s efforts to creatively share its journalism and storytelling across an ever-exploding array of platforms. She will oversee the News & Alerting, Special Projects, and Mobile & Off-Platform teams. Mitra will be based in the Big Apple and report to Editor-in-Chief Meredith Artley.
Since no one really likes press releases, we decided to mix things up with a Q&A. Read on and join us in welcoming Mitra to CNN: @MitraKalita.
What’s your guilty pleasure?
Chips. Uber. Bright tights. The Office. The TV show, not the place.
VP of Programming sounds like a TV title.  What does that mean for Digital?   
The success of our journalism rests on two important factors: how good is the story and how good is the distribution. How adaptive are we to different devices and different platforms? How accessible, relatable, intimate, authoritative? Technically, I will oversee the homepage, alerts, projects and planning, mobile news and off-platform partnerships and initiatives. But really, I see this job as one that collaborates across departments, time zones and mediums to maximize the reach of our journalism.
If you weren’t a journalist, what would you be doing?
I can’t think of anything else I’d rather do.

He founded and operates Helping Hands Foundations both in the U.S. and Korea, and is an active participant with numerous other charities including The Caring Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and Pearl S. Buck International.

Trump defends criticism of judge with Mexican heritage
 
Text Highlights
 
Trump on Clinton’s “thin skin” comment: “Well, first of all, I don't have thin skin, I have very, very strong, very thick skin.  And when somebody is right about me, I always - you know, if you do a report and it's not necessarily positive but you're right, I never complain. I do complain when it's a lie or when it's wrong.  But I have a strong temperament and it's a very good temperament and it's a very in control temperament or I wouldn't have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn't have built all of the things that I've been able to do in life. I mean, number one best-sellers, one of the best-selling books of all time, tremendous television success...[TAPPER]  I don't think anyone is... [TRUMP] I've been successful. Well, wait a minute, Jake. I've been successful in every business I've been in, if you think, real estate one of the most successful.  Uh, television, "The Apprentice," which is, forget it.  I mean NBC came to me.  They wanted to renew so badly you have no idea. [TAPPER]  But what does that have to do with temperament?...... [TRUMP] Oh, you can't have that success without good temperament. And I will say this.  I was thinking about the word temperament.  And we need a strong temperament in this country.  We have been led by weak people, weak ineffective people.  Countries have taken advantage of us, whether it's militarily or otherwise.  We have been taken advantage of by everybody.  We have people with weak temperaments. I have a very strong temperament.  But I have a temperament that's totally under control.  And, you know, you - she - she mentions that I'll bring us into war.  She's the one that wanted to go into Iraq.  I mean she raised her hand.  She didn't know what the hell she was doing.  She raised her hand. I said, I don't want to go into Iraq, Iraq is going to destabilize the Middle East and I was 100 percent right.”
 
 
Trump responds to criticism of judge with Mexican heritage “….[TRUMP] Do you know that these people went to every attorney general, practically, in the country that they could and do you know this case was turned down by almost every attorney general, from Texas to Florida to many of these states? [TAPPER]  Is it not, when Hillary Clinton says this is a racist attack and you reject that, if you are saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism? [TRUMP]  No, I don't think so at all. [TAPPER]  No? [TRUMP]  No.  He's proud of his heritage.  I - I respect him for that. [TAPPER]  But you're saying he can't do his job because of that. [TRUMP]  Look, he's proud of his heritage, OK.  I'm building a wall.  Now, I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. [TAPPER]  He's a legal citizen... [TRUMP]  You know why I'm going to do well with Hispanics? Because I'm going to bring back jobs and they're going to get jobs right now.  They're going to get jobs.  I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. But we're building a wall.  He's a Mexican.  We're building a wall between here and Mexico.  The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings, rulings that people can't even believe.  This case should have ended years ago on summary judgment.  The best lawyers - I have spoken to so many lawyers, they said this is not a case, this is a case that should have ended. [TAPPER]  I have... [TRUMP]  This judge is giving us unfair rulings. Now I say why? Well, I want to - I'm building a wall, OK, and it's a wall between Mexico, not another country...”

Donald Trump rails against judge's 'Mexican heritage'
 
CNN Story: 
Trump defends criticism of judge with Mexican heritage
 
Text Highlights
 
Trump on Clinton’s “thin skin” comment: “Well, first of all, I don't have thin skin, I have very, very strong, very thick skin.  And when somebody is right about me, I always - you know, if you do a report and it's not necessarily positive but you're right, I never complain. I do complain when it's a lie or when it's wrong.  But I have a strong temperament and it's a very good temperament and it's a very in control temperament or I wouldn't have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn't have built all of the things that I've been able to do in life. I mean, number one best-sellers, one of the best-selling books of all time, tremendous television success...[TAPPER]  I don't think anyone is... [TRUMP] I've been successful. Well, wait a minute, Jake. I've been successful in every business I've been in, if you think, real estate one of the most successful.  Uh, television, "The Apprentice," which is, forget it.  I mean NBC came to me.  They wanted to renew so badly you have no idea. [TAPPER]  But what does that have to do with temperament?...... [TRUMP] Oh, you can't have that success without good temperament. And I will say this.  I was thinking about the word temperament.  And we need a strong temperament in this country.  We have been led by weak people, weak ineffective people.  Countries have taken advantage of us, whether it's militarily or otherwise.  We have been taken advantage of by everybody.  We have people with weak temperaments. I have a very strong temperament.  But I have a temperament that's totally under control.  And, you know, you - she - she mentions that I'll bring us into war.  She's the one that wanted to go into Iraq.  I mean she raised her hand.  She didn't know what the hell she was doing.  She raised her hand. I said, I don't want to go into Iraq, Iraq is going to destabilize the Middle East and I was 100 percent right.”
 
 
Trump responds to criticism of judge with Mexican heritage “….[TRUMP] Do you know that these people went to every attorney general, practically, in the country that they could and do you know this case was turned down by almost every attorney general, from Texas to Florida to many of these states? [TAPPER]  Is it not, when Hillary Clinton says this is a racist attack and you reject that, if you are saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism? [TRUMP]  No, I don't think so at all. [TAPPER]  No? [TRUMP]  No.  He's proud of his heritage.  I - I respect him for that. [TAPPER]  But you're saying he can't do his job because of that. [TRUMP]  Look, he's proud of his heritage, OK.  I'm building a wall.  Now, I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. [TAPPER]  He's a legal citizen... [TRUMP]  You know why I'm going to do well with Hispanics? Because I'm going to bring back jobs and they're going to get jobs right now.  They're going to get jobs.  I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. But we're building a wall.  He's a Mexican.  We're building a wall between here and Mexico.  The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings, rulings that people can't even believe.  This case should have ended years ago on summary judgment.  The best lawyers - I have spoken to so many lawyers, they said this is not a case, this is a case that should have ended. [TAPPER]  I have... [TRUMP]  This judge is giving us unfair rulings. Now I say why? Well, I want to - I'm building a wall, OK, and it's a wall between Mexico, not another country...”

Text Highlights
 
Trump on Clinton’s “thin skin” comment: Well, first of all, I don't have thin skin, I have very, very strong, very thick skin.  And when somebody is right about me, I always - you know, if you do a report and it's not necessarily positive but you're right, I never complain. I do complain when it's a lie or when it's wrong.  But I have a strong temperament and it's a very good temperament and it's a very in control temperament or I wouldn't have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn't have built all of the things that I've been able to do in life. I mean, number one best-sellers, one of the best-selling books of all time, tremendous television success...[TAPPER]  I don't think anyone is... [TRUMP] I've been successful. Well, wait a minute, Jake. I've been successful in every business I've been in, if you think, real estate one of the most successful.  Uh, television, "The Apprentice," which is, forget it.  I mean NBC came to me.  They wanted to renew so badly you have no idea. [TAPPER]  But what does that have to do with temperament?...... [TRUMP] Oh, you can't have that success without good temperament. And I will say this.  I was thinking about the word temperament.  And we need a strong temperament in this country.  We have been led by weak people, weak ineffective people.  Countries have taken advantage of us, whether it's militarily or otherwise.  We have been taken advantage of by everybody.  We have people with weak temperaments. I have a very strong temperament.  But I have a temperament that's totally under control.  And, you know, you - she - she mentions that I'll bring us into war.  She's the one that wanted to go into Iraq.  I mean she raised her hand.  She didn't know what the hell she was doing.  She raised her hand. I said, I don't want to go into Iraq, Iraq is going to destabilize the Middle East and I was 100 percent right.
 
 
Trump responds to criticism of judge with Mexican heritage “….[TRUMP] Do you know that these people went to every attorney general, practically, in the country that they could and do you know this case was turned down by almost every attorney general, from Texas to Florida to many of these states? [TAPPER]  Is it not, when Hillary Clinton says this is a racist attack and you reject that, if you are saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism? [TRUMP]  No, I don't think so at all. [TAPPER]  No? [TRUMP]  No.  He's proud of his heritage.  I - I respect him for that. [TAPPER]  But you're saying he can't do his job because of that. [TRUMP]  Look, he's proud of his heritage, OK.  I'm building a wall.  Now, I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. [TAPPER]  He's a legal citizen... [TRUMP]  You know why I'm going to do well with Hispanics? Because I'm going to bring back jobs and they're going to get jobs right now.  They're going to get jobs.  I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics. But we're building a wall.  He's a Mexican.  We're building a wall between here and Mexico.  The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings, rulings that people can't even believe.  This case should have ended years ago on summary judgment.  The best lawyers - I have spoken to so many lawyers, they said this is not a case, this is a case that should have ended. [TAPPER]  I have... [TRUMP]  This judge is giving us unfair rulings. Now I say why? Well, I want to - I'm building a wall, OK, and it's a wall between Mexico, not another country...”

CNN to deliver comprehensive EU referendum coverage 
Multiplatform news, debate and analysis of UK’s crucial vote
London, 2 June 2016: As the UK prepares to vote on whether to remain in the European Union, CNN will offer a mix of special ‘Brexit’ programming to audiences around the world, across TV and digital platforms.
Leading up to the poll on 23 June, CNN’s most experienced journalists will be getting to grips with the issues facing UK voters, and the implications of their decision for Europe and the world.  The network will take to the UK’s roads, host an interactive debate show, and provide the latest news and reaction as the results come in.
Gill Penlington, Director of News & Event Programming, EMEA at CNN International, said: “There is so much information, misinformation, conjecture and opinion around this vitally important story.  We’ll be talking to leading lights from all angles of the debate, debunking some of the myths, and getting into the minds of the voters whose decision will have implications across the world.”
Following the story will be CNN journalists including anchors Hala Gorani, Max Foster, and Nina dos Santos, as well as Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson.  They will be joined by CNNMoney Editor at Large, Richard Quest, and Chief International Correspondent, Christiane Amanpour.
Key programming and content:
On digital:
Full coverage of the referendum can be found at CNN.com/Brexit – including explainers, opinion, and the very latest news.
On CNN International:
From Monday 13 June, Richard Quest will be taking to the UK’s roads in a 1970s campervan for a week, to get the mood on the ground.  Visiting iconic locations he will talk to voters, as well as leading voices from business, politics, academia and culture.  In addition to updates through the day on CNN International and extensive coverage on CNNMoney, Quest Means Business will also be anchored live from the campervan throughout the week at 9pm GMT/10pm CET.
On Thursday 16 June at 7pm BST/8pm CET, Christiane Amanpour will host an interactive ‘Brexit reality check’.  Recorded at the McLaren Thought Leadership Centre, UK Decides: In or Out will feature a panel of high profile guests from both sides of the debate. Max Foster will be marshalling the studio audience, who will use high tech, interactive voting technology to have their say in real time on the key issues.
On Thursday 23 June, the day of the referendum itself, CNN will present coverage throughout the day.  Then, from the moment the polls close, at 10pm GMT/11pm CET, there will be rolling coverage of the results.  Anchored live from London, with correspondents stationed in key locations in the UK and Europe, CNN will bring up-to-the-minute developments through the night as the votes are counted.  The result will then be dissected the next day, with the ramifications for the UK, Europe and the world put under the microscope.
ENDS

Update! Season Four Premiere of CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man Launches Friday, June 3, 10pm, ET/PT 
New Season Includes Spurlock’s Inside Look at Space, Gambling, Toxins, Disruptors, CSI and Gamers
Popular CNN Original Series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man, hosted and produced by the Oscar®-nominated documentary filmmaker, launches its fourth season on Friday, June 3 at 10pm ET/PT with an inside look at professional gambling.
In his inimitable, inquisitive style, and with a sense of humor intact, Spurlock tells compelling stories from an insider’s perspective. In the new season Morgan tackles toxins, gambling, the space industry, disruptors, gaming, and crime scene investigations.
The multiple award-winning program averaged 546,000 total viewers and 244,000 Adults 25-54 for premiere episodes in season three (1/22-3/19/15) and posted its highest season performance ever among both Adults 25-54 and total viewers. It surpassed its season two average (airing on Sundays at 10pm) by 7% in Adults 25-54 (228,000) and 27% in total viewers (429,000).*

Below are descriptions of Morgan Spurlock Inside Man season four episodes (airdates subject to change):
DOUBLE OR NOTHING (airdate June 3 2016)
Spurlock enters the seductive world of professional gambling by spending a week in Las Vegas determined to beat the house. His exploration of this pastime, which often leads to serious addiction, takes him to casinos, bookies, the racetrack, Off Track Betting and just about any place that allows him to gamble.
ONE GIANT STEP FOR MORGAN (airdate June 10, 2016)
Spurlock “virtually” experiences life as an astronaut and investigates the future of the space industry. The host’s journey takes him to government and private facilities including NASA’s Johnson Space Center (Houston), the X-Prize Foundation (Culver City, CA.) and Virgin Atlantic’s Mojave Air & Space Port (CA.) to see how the rules of the game are changing and what it means for the human race.
THE TRUTH ABOUT TOXINS  (airdate June 17, 2016)
In a quest to rid his life of contaminants – which are prominent in food, cleaning products and even furniture, Spurlock gets professional help to “de-tox.” The host puts his body to the test, dabbling in chelation therapy, infrared saunas, electromagnetic-free sleep chambers, and various cleanses, to see if poisons can truly be flushed out of our bodies and surroundings in the modern world.
CSI: SPURLOCK (airdate June 24, 2016)
Separating fact from TV dramatizations, Spurlock embeds in a forensic science unit to understand first-hand how crime scene investigations are actually conducted.  From the first responders, to the collection of evidence (at CSI Academy in Alachua, FL and ATF training facility in Huntsville, AL) and its analysis in the lab, he gets a crash course in Crime 101 from beginning to end.
GAME CHANGERS (airdate July 1, 2016)
Screaming fans, sold-out arenas, and teenage superstars, Spurlock joins the ranks of professional video gamers in one of the fastest-growing sectors of the “sports” world. Committed to understanding this shockingly intense industry, he joins reigning League of Legends North American Champions, from Counter Logic Gaming, as they train to compete for a big cash prize at the World Championship in Paris.
SEEK AND DISRUPT! (airdate July 8, 2016)
Inspired by companies like Google, AirBnB, and Spotify, Spurlock attempts to fill a void in the marketplace and re-write the rules by becoming the next disruptor. An eye-opening trip to Silicon Valley provides industry advice from tech giants, and examines why companies like Uber often leave a trail of enemies in their wake and questions whether this golden era of tech will solve age-old problems.

Meet CNN Digital's New VP of Programming: Mitra Kalita 
Meet Mitra Kalita. She’ll be making a big move from the left coast to the right to head up programming for CNN Digital in the coming weeks. Mitra joins CNN from the Los Angeles Times, where she is serving as the publication’s managing editor. Before that, she was the executive editor of Quartz. She’s also worked for the Wall Street Journal, Mint and the Washington Post.
In her new role as VP of Programming, Mitra will lead CNN Digital’s efforts to creatively share its journalism and storytelling across an ever-exploding array of platforms. She will oversee the News & Alerting, Special Projects, and Mobile & Off-Platform teams. Mitra will be based in the Big Apple and report to Editor-in-Chief Meredith Artley.
Since no one really likes press releases, we decided to mix things up with a Q&A. Read on and join us in welcoming Mitra to CNN: @MitraKalita.
What’s your guilty pleasure?
Chips. Uber. Bright tights. The Office. The TV show, not the place.
VP of Programming sounds like a TV title.  What does that mean for Digital?   
The success of our journalism rests on two important factors: how good is the story and how good is the distribution. How adaptive are we to different devices and different platforms? How accessible, relatable, intimate, authoritative? Technically, I will oversee the homepage, alerts, projects and planning, mobile news and off-platform partnerships and initiatives. But really, I see this job as one that collaborates across departments, time zones and mediums to maximize the reach of our journalism.
If you weren’t a journalist, what would you be doing?
I can’t think of anything else I’d rather do.

Two-Time Super Bowl Champ and 'Dancing with the Stars'  Mirrorball Winner Hines Ward Joins HLN’S 'Morning Express With Robin Meade' As Sports Contributor 
TWO-TIME SUPER BOWL CHAMP AND 'DANCING WITH THE STARS' MIRRORBALL WINNER HINES WARD JOINS HLN’S 'MORNING EXPRESS WITH ROBIN MEADE' AS SPORTS CONTRIBUTOR
Ward to Also Provide Sports Commentary and Analysis Across all CNN Platforms
Hines Ward, two-time Super Bowl champion and Dancing with the Stars Mirrorball trophy winner, joins HLN’s Morning Express with Robin Meade as sports contributor.  Based at the network’s headquarters in Atlanta, Ward will also provide analysis and commentary on major sporting events and breaking news across all CNN platforms, including CNN/U.S., CNN Digital, CNNMoney and CNN International.
Beginning July 1, the Super Bowl XL MVP, joins the popular HLN morning crew of host Robin Meade, meteorologist Bob Van Dillen and consumer business correspondent Jennifer Westhoven. Morning Express with Robin Meade is a ratings juggernaut for the network.  The wildly successful morning show is up double-digits year-to-date in both total viewers and persons 25-54.
“I’m incredibly grateful to HLN and CNN for welcoming me to their prestigious team,” said Ward. “Throughout my career, I’ve always envisioned myself as more than just a football player and this platform will allow me to express myself in different and unique ways. I’m excited to be able to share my journey and my stories with our audiences, both in the US and worldwide.”
“Hines is a true champion with such a winning personality,” said Bill Galvin, SVP, Sports Programming, CNN.  “His perspective on sports extends well beyond the football field – a fresh voice we’re excited to share with HLN and CNN audiences.”
Upon his retirement in 2012 from the NFL, where here he played for 14 years with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ward trained and completed the 2013 Ironman World Championships held annually in Hawaii. He began his television career as an analyst for NBC’s Sunday primetime NFL show, Football Night in America.
He founded and operates Helping Hands Foundations both in the U.S. and Korea, and is an active participant with numerous other charities including The Caring Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and Pearl S. Buck International. Ward also started an after-school education program for kids in his home state of Georgia, where he attended Forest Park High School and went on to be a top scholar-athlete at the University of Georgia, earning All-SEC honors his senior year and finishing his college career as Georgia's second all-time receiver with 144 receptions. He currently lives in Atlanta with his wife and son.
Ward is represented by CSE Talent, which offers management and career assistance to its elite roster of over 200 clients including pro and collegiate coaches, baseball players, golfers, management, and news and sport media talent.

Two-Time Super Bowl Champ and 'Dancing with the Stars'  Mirrorball Winner Hines Ward Joins HLN’S 'Morning Express With Robin Meade' As Sports Contributor 
TWO-TIME SUPER BOWL CHAMP AND 'DANCING WITH THE STARS' MIRRORBALL WINNER HINES WARD JOINS HLN’S 'MORNING EXPRESS WITH ROBIN MEADE' AS SPORTS CONTRIBUTOR
Ward to Also Provide Sports Commentary and Analysis Across all CNN Platforms
Hines Ward, two-time Super Bowl champion and Dancing with the Stars Mirrorball trophy winner, joins HLN’s Morning Express with Robin Meade as sports contributor.  Based at the network’s headquarters in Atlanta, Ward will also provide analysis and commentary on major sporting events and breaking news across all CNN platforms, including CNN/U.S., CNN Digital, CNNMoney and CNN International.
Beginning July 1, the Super Bowl XL MVP, joins the popular HLN morning crew of host Robin Meade, meteorologist Bob Van Dillen and consumer business correspondent Jennifer Westhoven. Morning Express with Robin Meade is a ratings juggernaut for the network.  The wildly successful morning show is up double-digits year-to-date in both total viewers and persons 25-54.
“I’m incredibly grateful to HLN and CNN for welcoming me to their prestigious team,” said Ward. “Throughout my career, I’ve always envisioned myself as more than just a football player and this platform will allow me to express myself in different and unique ways. I’m excited to be able to share my journey and my stories with our audiences, both in the US and worldwide.”
“Hines is a true champion with such a winning personality,” said Bill Galvin, SVP, Sports Programming, CNN.  “His perspective on sports extends well beyond the football field – a fresh voice we’re excited to share with HLN and CNN audiences.”
Upon his retirement in 2012 from the NFL, where here he played for 14 years with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ward trained and completed the 2013 Ironman World Championships held annually in Hawaii. He began his television career as an analyst for NBC’s Sunday primetime NFL show, Football Night in America.
He founded and operates Helping Hands Foundations both in the U.S. and Korea, and is an active participant with numerous other charities including The Caring Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and Pearl S. Buck International. Ward also started an after-school education program for kids in his home state of Georgia, where he attended Forest Park High School and went on to be a top scholar-athlete at the University of Georgia, earning All-SEC honors his senior year and finishing his college career as Georgia's second all-time receiver with 144 receptions. He currently lives in Atlanta with his wife and son.
Ward is represented by CSE Talent, which offers management and career assistance to its elite roster of over 200 clients including pro and collegiate coaches, baseball players, golfers, management, and news and sport media talent.
